## Applicable Law

- The common law applies to all sales of service contracts and the UCC applies to sale of goods.Here,the contract is for cleaning services(a service) so that it clearly falls whithin the ambit of the common law.As such,none of the rules under the UCC will be applicable.

## Valid Contract Formed

- Before addressing wheher Maria breached her contract with Resi-Clean("RC"),it must first be determined whether she had a valid contract to begin with.A valid contract requires:(1)an offer;(2)an acceptance of the before mentioned offer;(3)consideration from each party;and (4)no defense to formation.Each will be discussed below.

### 1.Offer

- For an offer to be valid there must be an intent to be bound,communicated to the offeree,with sufficient and definite material terms.Here,there are several points at which the parties may argue an offer was made.Whether or not a valid offer is made(i.e.whether above factors are met)is determined by looking at whether a reasonable person receiving the communication would feel that their acceptance of the offer would create a binding obligation.

- First,it may be argued that the handbills placed on the doorknobs of the houses created an offer from RC to all of the houses.However,this argument is likely to fail.An advertisement that merely states the cost of service,a phone number,and possible coupons would not be construed by a reasonable person to evidence the intent of adverstising to be bound to a contract upon acceptance.

- Thus,this would not likely be construed as a valid offer.Howeve,a court may accept an argument by Maria the the coupon attached the sepecified that the party would get $20 off if they called within 24 hours and ordered a top-to-bottom cleaning was a valid offer because it was sepcific with terms of how it could be accepted,when it had to be accepted by,and a reasonable person would feel that the party giving the coupon would be bound by the offer.The effect of the binding effect of the coupon will be discussed further with respect to the damages that Maria receives below.
