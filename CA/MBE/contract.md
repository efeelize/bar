# 1.minors

> Unmarried, unemancipated minors (ie, persons under the age of 18) lack capacity to contract because of their infancy. As a result, any contract entered by a minor is voidable by the minor.This means that the minor can either：

- ***void*** the contract before or soon after turning 18 by (1) disaffirming the contract through words or actions and (2) returning any still-existing benefit received under the contract or

- ***ratify*** the contract after turning 18 by (1) failing to timely void the contract or (2) otherwise agreeing to be bound by it—eg, by attempting to render performance of or payment under the contract.

## 1.misunderstanding【条款理解不同】

> [如果双方对实质性条款理解都不同，合同没有成立，如果一方知道对方的想法，合同按照对方所想成立]It occurs when the parties to a contract attach **different meanings** to the **same term**. If the misunderstanding involves a **material term**, most often there is no contract because there is no meeting of the minds.But if **one party knows or has reason to know about the misunderstanding**, then a valid contract will be formed based on the meaning of the **term as understood** by the **unknowing party**.

- Trade usage can be used to show that a word or phrase has a particular meaning—eg, that "daily service" does not include Sundays in the commercial laundry business. But trade usage will not control when a party knows that the other party attaches a different meaning to the term.

- When one party to a contract knows or has reason to know that the other party attaches a different meaning to a material term, then the unknowing party's meaning of the term will control.

# 四、合同的解释
## 1.Rules of contract interpretation

> The plain-meaning rule of contract interpretation instructs courts to rely on the ordinary meaning of the words if the contract's language is clear and unambiguous.

|rule|Court's interpret|
| ------ | ------ |
| Plain-meaning rule | Court interprets contract terms according to their plain meaning(unless parties clearly intended specialized meaning) |
| Plain-meaning rule | Goal is to effectuate parties' outward expressions of intent |
| Plain-meaning rule | Extrinsic evidence may be used to clarify ambiguous or overlyvague terms |
| Context rule | Court interprets contract terms by considering all facts &circumstances related to transaction |
| Context rule | (some courts)Goal is to effectuate parties' actual intent |

# 2.The parol evidence rule [口头证据规则]

> The parol evidence rule generally bars evidence of a prior oral or written agreement to modify or contradict the terms of a final written agreement. However, parol evidence is admissible to establish an ambiguous term—eg, when a term is subject to a misunderstanding.

# 3.contra proferentem[不利解释原则]

> Contra proferentem is a legal principle used in contract interpretation. It means that if there is any ambiguity in a contract, the interpretation should be made against the party that drafted the contract. This rule helps protect the weaker or non-drafting party, ensuring that the drafter does not benefit from unclear language.

> Under the doctrine of contra proferentem, ambiguous contract terms are interpreted against the drafter to protect the rights of the nondrafter. But this doctrine does not apply when, as here, the terms are unambiguous.
