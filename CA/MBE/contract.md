# 1.contract fundamentals

> CL:common law.

> UCC:uniform commercial code.

> offeror:person that makes an offer.

> offeree:person to whom an offer is made.

> merchant:person who deals in goods of the kind.

## 1.1 bilateral vs.unilateral contract

- bilateral contract:a contract formed by an ***exchange of promises***
- unilateral contract:involves only 1 promise(by offeror)that expressly require ***performance to accept***.contract in formed ***only when*** offeree completes performance.

## 1.2 express vs.implied contract

- express:formed by express written or oral terms.
- implied-in-fact:formed by ***conduct*** of the parties.
- implied-in-law/Quasi-contract:***not*** a contract,is a ***restitution remedy*** to prevent unjust enrichment.

## 1.3 void,voidable,& unenforceable

- void:no conract exists,agreemnet has ***no legal effect***.
- voidable:problem with the contract exists,but it ***may*** be enforced or rejected at the ***opion*** of one party.
- unenforceable:is a valid contract that ***cannot*** be enforced cuz a defense applies.

# 1.如果同时出现普通法（UCC）和衡平法的适用选择

- 我们要关注合同是否成立，如果合同成立，一般来说按照前面的赔偿金解决问题，除非造成明显的不公。只有当合同没有成立时才用衡平法理论解决问题，比如准合同、禁反言等;
- “让人做某事”，“不让人做某事”是衡平法的救济，普通法关注金钱上的赔偿;
- 普通法救济足够的时候，不用衡平法救济;
- 衡平法由法官审理事实，而不是陪审团;
- 普通法通常严格遵循法律和先例（先例也是法律的一部分），而衡平法更关注结果是否公平，但公平并非只有一种答案.

| / |  common law |  UCC |
| --- | --- | ---- |
| Promise to hold offer open | Must be supported by consideration (ie, option contract) | No consideration required when merchant gives written & signed assurance [商人作出书面并签署的保证时，无需对价](ie, firm offer不可撤销要约) |
| Contract formation[合同成立] | Must have offer & acceptance with knowledge of that offer | Any manner sufficient to show agreement[任何足以表明合意的方式] |
| Acceptance[承诺] | Must agree to exact terms of offer (ie, mirror-image rule) | Effective even with new/contradictory terms |
| Required term[必要条款] | Description of property/service Quantity Price Time for performance[财产/服务的描述、数量、价格、履行时间] | Description of goods Quantity |
| Bilateral modification[双方变更] | Must be supported by new consideration | New consideration not required if made in good faith[如果出于善意，则不需要新的对价] |
| Unilateral discharge[单方解除] | Death Destruction of subject matter Impracticability | / |
| Suing for breach | Must be in privity (ie, party to contract) or intended beneficiary[必须有合同相对性（即，合同当事人）或为预期受益人] | No privity/beneficiary requirement |

- 在普通法下，一份合同若要有效且可强制执行，其必须涵盖所有基本条款。这些条款必须足够确定和明确，以便法院能够判断是否存在违约行为并给出适当的救济。否则，合同会因不确定性而无效。

## 1.1 battle of the forms[格式之战，要约答复中新增条款的效力]

### （1） common law

- mirror-image,Offer rejected，Reply treated as counteroffer.一项承诺只有在与要约条款呈镜像关系时才有效。

### (2)UCC

> The UCC uses the battle-of-the-forms rule, where any reasonable manifestation of acceptance - even one including new terms - is effective unless it is expressly conditioned on the offeror's assent to the new terms.
> 如果接收方提出了一些新的条件，甚至修改了一些提出方的条件，依然可以视为接受要约，这时我们称双方的制式表格有冲突（battle of forms），但是合同的关键条款(essential terms)不能有分歧。

#### (2.1) 视情况决定能否成为合同的一部分

- 如果合同的任何一方不是商家，新提出或修改的条款只视为建议（proposal），在另一方接受之前，不会成为合同的一部分。
- 合同的双方都是商家，接收方修改原条款后，双方的条款都不采纳（knock out rule）,而是采用UCC的默认规则进行；
- 仅仅提出新条款，通常可以成为合同的一部分，除非：（1）实质性的修改（materially alter）原要约，通常都是和行业惯例有很大的不同，比如减少自己的质保义务[重大修改不视为合同的一部分]

#### （2.2）要约明确限制增加新条款

#### （2.3）对方明确反对新条款，或者在收到新条款之后的合理时间内提出反对

## 1.2 mailbox rule[邮箱规则]

| / |  effective time |
| ---- | ---- |
| Offeror[要约人]'s actions: Offer, Revocation of offer | Effective upon receipt |
| Offeree[受要约人]'s actions: Acceptance[承诺] (mailbox rule) | Effective upon dispatch[发出时生效].Exceptions - effective upon receipt if:(1)improperly stamped/addressed[邮票不足或地址错误];(2)acceptance by mail unreasonable[通过邮件承诺不合理];(3)rejection mailed before acceptance (first received is effective);(4)acceptance of option contract[选择权合同的承诺] |
| Offeree's actions: Rejection[拒绝]/counteroffer[反要约] | Effective upon receipt |

- 根据邮箱规则 (mailbox rule)，通过邮寄或类似方式发送的承诺通常在发出时生效，而拒绝则在收到时生效。
- 先寄出同意要约，后寄出拒绝要约，则前一个寄出时合同已经成立。除非提出要约的人先收到了拒绝要约的信，并基于对拒绝的信赖作出后续安排。
- 先寄出拒绝要约，后寄出接受要约，以对方**先收到**的信为准，不适用邮箱规则。
- 约提出人撤回要约，对方知悉被撤回之前寄出了同意要约，则合同依然成立。但如果已经知悉要约被撤回，被提出人无法同意要约。
- 为承诺一项要约，受要约人必须表现出受要约条款约束的客观意图，并遵守要约中关于承诺的时间、地点或方式的任何具体规定，此时也不适用邮箱规则。比如要约声明，承诺必须在6月25日之前被收到才有效，实际上在26号收到，此时该承诺是无效的。

> Under the mailbox rule, acceptance of an offer is generally effective upon dispatch. However, one exception to the mailbox rule applies to option contracts, where acceptance is effective upon receipt.

## 1.3 Merchant exception[UCC]

- 双方如果都是商家，虽然没有书面合同，但如果一方把口头合意及时以书面形式送达给对方，对方没有在10天内提出书面反对，视为满足反欺诈法的要求。
- 但书面形式必须有签名用来针对起草方（发出方），否则也无法用来针对被送达方.

> Under the merchant exception, a written confirmation need only be **signed by one merchant** and sent to the other merchant. If the recipient has reason to know the confirmation's contents and does not object within **10 days**, then it is **enforceable against both merchants**.

## 1.4 UCC gap fillers

> Contracts for the sale of goods (eg, faucets) are governed by Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC). The UCC "fills the gap" when certain terms are missing from a contract. For example, the gap filler for a missing place of delivery is generally the seller's place of business if the seller has one. And unless the contract specifies otherwise[除非合同另有规定], payment is due at the time and place the buyer is to receive each shipment of goods. In that case, the seller is only required to deliver the goods if the buyer tenders the payment[只有在买方支付货款时，卖方才有义务交付货物].

| Missing terms | Gap fillers |
| ---- | ----- |
| Place of delivery | (1)seller's place of  business if applicable;(2)seller's home;(3)some other place if parties know goods are there |
| Time for shipment/delivery | reasonable time |
| Price | reasonable price at time for delivery |
| Time/place for payment | Time & place buyer is to receive goods |

### （1）不适用的情形

- Identity of the contracting parties
- Subject matter of the contract[合同标的物]
- Quantity of goods to be sold[数量条款必须明确一个确定的数额，或者能够通过参照客观事实使其确定。]

> A contract must therefore specify a quantity that is certain or determinable by reference to objective facts[可通过参照客观事实来确定], such as the buyer's actual requirements or the seller's actual output in a requirements or output contract[需求合同或产量合同中，参照买方的实际需求或卖方的实际产量]. If it does not, the contract fails for indefiniteness[合同将因不确定而无效].

### （2）knockout rule [剔除规则]

> In contracts between merchants, conflicting terms in the offer and acceptance are canceled out under the knockout rule and replaced with UCC gap-filling provisions (eg, delivery within a reasonable time).

## 1.5 一项要求立即发货的货物购买要约[UCC]

- promising to ship the goods;
- shipping goods that conform to the order;
- shipping nonconforming goods without notice that they are being offered only as an accommodation. ie, notice of accommodation. [发运不符规格的货物，且未通知此举仅为通融，即通融通知]

> Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code ( UCC ) governs contracts for the sale of goods (eg, computers). Under the UCC, a seller can accept a buyer's offer to purchase goods for prompt or immediate shipment by promising to ship, or shipping, the goods. Once the offer is accepted, the shipped goods must **conform perfectly** to the contract.

### （1）Seller's reply to buyer's offer

| Reply | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| Promise to ship | Acceptance |
| Shipment of conforming goods | Acceptance & performance |
| Shipment of nonconforming goods + With notice of accommodation | Rejection & counteroffer |
| Shipment of nonconforming goods + With no notice | Acceptance & breach |

- with notice:the buyer may accept the shipment (creating a contract for the nonconforming goods从而就该不符货物成立一份合同,and the buyer did not sustain any damages) OR reject the shipment (creating no contract).
- with no notice:Nonconformance is a breach that allows the buyer to **accept or reject** the goods in whole or in part. The buyer can also **recover any damages** suffered as a result of the breach.

## 1.6 mirror-image rule[镜像规则]

> Under this rule, an acceptance must match the terms of the offer exactly. A purported acceptance that contains different or additional terms acts as a rejection of the original offer and as a counteroffer[均构成对原要约的拒绝和一项反要约].
> However, mere suggestions or inquiries that the offeror is free to accept or reject do not. The offeree can therefore accept the original offer in spite of such suggestions or inquiries.

# 2.offer
## 2.1 Irrevocable offers[不可撤回的要约]

| Type | Description | Consideration | Duration |
| --- | --- | --- | ---- |
| UCC Firm offer | Merchant gives written & signed assurance that offer will remain open[商家以书面形式并签署保证，确保要约保持开放]  | Not required | Specified or reasonable time |
| Common law Option contract[选择权合同] | Offeror promises to keep offer open in exchange for consideration[要约人承诺保持要约开放以换取对价] | Required | Reasonable time for full performance |
| Common law Partial performance /unilateral contracts[单方合同] | Offeror invites acceptance only by performance & offeree begins to perform[要约人仅以履行方式邀请承诺，且受要约人已开始履行] | Not required | Reasonable time for full performance |
| Promissory estoppel/detrimental reliance | Offeror could reasonably foresee reliance on offer & offeree reasonably relies to his/her detriment[要约人可合理预见到受要约人将信赖其要约，且受要约人已合理信赖该要约并因此遭受损害] | Not required | Reasonable time |

### (1) 普通法

- 不可撤回的要约视为一个单独的选择权合同(option contract)。既然是合同，就要求对方支付一定的对价（consideration），用于将选择权保留一段时间。
- 该承诺不需要书面作出。

### (2) UCC:firm offer

- 1.提出人必须是商家（merchant）;
- 2.书面提出;
- 3.明确表示要约会保留一段时间。请注意，如果被提出人没有支付对价，要约最多**三个月**后就可以撤销。
- 商人以书面形式作出并签署的、保证要约保持有效的承诺，其不可撤销期间不能超过3个月，即使要约中声明了更长的期限。

## 2.2 offer to form a bilateral contract

- Notice is not required to accept an offer by starting performance unless the offer so requires[除非要约本身有此要求，否则通过开始履行来接受要约无需发出通知].
- However, if the offeree should know that the offeror has no convenient way of learning within a reasonable time that performance has begun, the offeree must notify the offeror. Failure to do so will discharge the offeror's contractual duty[如果受要约人理应知道要约人在合理时间内没有便捷的方式得知履行已经开始，则受要约人必须通知要约人。若未能这样做，将免除要约人的合同义务].

> An offer to form a bilateral contract  - ie, an offer that invites acceptance by return promise - can be expressly accepted with a return promise[明确承诺] or impliedly accepted by starting performance[实际履行].

## 2.3 unilateral contract [单方合同]

- 无论是单方合同还是双方合同的要约，该要约都必须合理地传达给受要约人，且受要约人必须知晓该要约，才能接受它。否则，就无法达成订立合同的双方合意。
- 当一方（要约人）承诺以某事换取另一方（受要约人）完成特定行为，而另一方（受要约人）通过完成所要求的行为来表示接受时，单方合同即告成立。 除非要约有此要求，否则**通知并非**使接受生效的必要条件。
- 如果受要约人**有理由知道**要约人无法在合理时间内知晓履约已完成，那么要约人的义务将被免除，除非：(1)受要约人尽到合理的努力通知要约人;(2)要约人在合理时间内知晓了履约情况或;(3)要约表明不需要接受通知。

> An offer to form a unilateral contract invites acceptance only by performance of a specified act, while an offer to form a bilateral contract invites acceptance by a promise to perform the act.
> A unilateral contract arises when one party (offeror) promises to do something in return for performance of a specific act and the other party (offeree) accepts by completing the requested performance. Notice is not required to make the acceptance effective unless the offer so requires. But if the offeree has reason to know that the offeror would not learn of the completed performance within a reasonable time, then the offeror's duty is discharged unless :
(1)the offeree exercises reasonable diligence to notify the offeror
(2)the offeror learns of the performance within a reasonable time or
(3)the offer indicates that notification of acceptance is not required.

## 2.4 illusory offer[虚幻要约]

- 虚幻要约是不对一方或双方施加义务的要约，因缺乏对价而是无效的。
- 一个最初虚幻的要约可以在以下情况下成为有约束力的允诺：（1）情况发生变化，使得该要约对双方都施加了义务；并且（2）该要约随后被承诺。

> Acceptance of an illusory offer is ineffective for lack of consideration. But such an offer can become a binding promise if (1) circumstances change such that the offer imposes obligations on both parties and (2) the offer is accepted.

## 2.5 要约的终止

- 承诺的发生，在于受要约人做出受要约条款约束的客观表示。要约人有权明确知晓受要约人是否接受要约;
- 受要约人的承诺必须是明确无误的（即，确定的），否则对任何一方均不产生约束力。并且，在受要约人接受要约之前，要约人可以撤销该要约。

### (1)Offeror's revocation[要约人的撤销]

- 要约人直接向受要约人传达撤销[Offeror communicates revocation directly to offeree]；
- 受要约人从可靠来源获悉了合理表明要约已被撤销的信息（例如，房屋已售予另一位买家）[Offeree learns information from reliable source that reasonably indicates offer was revoked (eg, house sold to another buyer)].

### (2)Offeree's rejection[受要约人的拒绝]

- 受要约人直接向要约人传达拒绝[Offeree communicates rejection directly to offeror]；
- 受要约人的反要约构成拒绝及新要约[Offeree's counteroffer serves as rejection & new offer]

### (3)Lapse[失效]

- 要约中规定的期限届满[Time period specified in offer expires];
- 若要约中未规定期限，则在合理时间后[After reasonable time if no time period specified in offer].

### (4)By law

- 任何一方当事人死亡或被裁定为精神失常[Either party dies or is adjudicated insane];
- 要约标的物被毁坏或变得不合法[Subject matter of offer is destroyed or becomes illegal].

# 3.Implied contracts [默示合同]

## 3.1 implied-in-law ("quasi") contract[法律默示（“准”）合同]

- 诚实并遵守合理的商业公平交易标准为防止不当得利，由法院构建的合同，即一方当事人从另一方获得利益，而提供利益的一方有理由期望得到补偿。例如，医生治疗昏迷者。

> Constructed by court to prevent unjust enrichment when party receives benefit from another who reasonably expects compensation Eg, physician treats unconscious person.

## 3.1 成立条件

- the plaintiff has conferred[授予] a measurable benefit (eg, medical services) on the defendant
- the plaintiff acted without gratuitous intent[原告的行为并非出于无偿意图] and
- it would be unfair to let the defendant retain the benefit without compensating the plaintiff.

> In the absence of any contractual relationship between the parties, courts have the power to construct an implied-in-law ("quasi") contract to prevent unjust enrichment[不当得利].

## 3.2 Unfair retention of a benefit[不公平地保留利益]

> Unfair retention of a benefit arises when (1) the defendant had an opportunity to decline the benefit but knowingly accepted it[有机会拒绝该利益但知情地接受了它] or (2) the plaintiff had a reasonable excuse for not giving the defendant such opportunity - often because of an emergency[原告有合理的理由没有给被告这样的机会——通常是由于紧急情况]. This allows the plaintiff in a quasi-contract action to recover restitutionary damages[返还性损害赔偿] equal to the reasonable value of the benefit conferred.

# 4.consideration

| consideration problems |  prevent contract formation |
| --- | --- |
| gift[赠与] |  No-bargained-for exchange |
| token consideration [象征性对价] | No inducement to bargain if performance entirely devoid of value [如果履行完全没有价值，则无交易诱因] |
| Sham consideration [虚假对价] | No legal detriment & no inducement to bargain if recited performance not intended to be completed [如果所述的履行本不打算完成，则无法律上的损害且无交易诱因] |
| Preexisting duty / past consideration | No legal detriment if performance already owed or completed |
| Illusory promise [虚幻的承诺] | No legal detriment if apparent promise imposes no obligation |

- 合同变更通常必须有新的对价支持——即，每一方都必须以某种方式改变其义务——除非该变更在不可预见的情形下是公平合理的。
- 履行已存义务的承诺或履行行为，不足以构成新的对价，且不会免除双方在初始（即未变更的）合同下的义务。

> For any agreement to be enforceable, there must be consideration  - ie, a bargained-for exchange of promises or performance[经交易协商而交换的承诺或履行]. The promise to perform, or the performance of, a preexisting duty does not qualify as consideration[履行已存义务的承诺或行为，不构成有效的对价]. Under this preexisting duty rule, a debtor's promise to pay all or part of a liquidated debt (ie, one that is certain and undisputed,数额确定且无争议) is not sufficient consideration to support a creditor's return promise.

## 4.1 Elements of valuable consideration

> Formation of a contract generally requires a bargained-for exchange of promises or performance (ie, valuable consideration有效对价 ). The bargained-for exchange requirement is not met unless each party's willingness to enter into the contract was induced by the other party's act or promise. So if either of the parties intended to make a gift , this requirement cannot be met.

### （1）bargained-for exchange[有对价的交换]

- 有效对价即经协商换取的承诺或履行；
- 放弃一项主张或抗辩的承诺构成对价（比如，签发一份免责地契）。只要（1）该主张或抗辩是有效的或处于善意纠纷之中，或（2）放弃方真诚地相信其可能是有效的。

> Each party's willingness to enter agreement must be induced by other party's act/promise.If there was no bargained-for exchange (ie, consideration) to support his promise, no contract arose between the parties, and the court should rule in favor of the man.

### (2)legal detriment[法律上的损害]

> Each party must relinquish[放弃] legal right by either: performing (or promising to perform) act that is not legally required or refraining (or promising to refrain) from performing legally permissible act.

## 4.2 无对价但有约束力的承诺

### （1）支付因技术性抗辩而被禁止的债务

- 承诺支付在没有技术性执行抗辩（例如，诉讼时效、破产）的情况下本可强制执行的债务.

> Promise to pay debt that would be enforceable absent technical defense to enforcement (eg, statute of limitations, bankruptcy).

### （2）履行可撤销的义务

- 承诺履行可撤销的义务，前提是新的承诺本身不是可撤销的（例如，未成年人在成年后再次确认履行合同的承诺）

> Promise to perform voidable duty, provided that new promise is not also voidable (eg, minor reaffirms promise to perform contract after reaching age of majority).

### （3）为已获得的物质利益支付

- 承诺为过去收到的且非意图作为赠与的物质利益付款（例如，承诺支付先前获得的紧急服务费用）

> Promise to pay for material benefits received in the past & not intended as a gift (eg, promise to pay for emergency services previously received).

### （4）Promissory estoppel[承诺性禁反言]/detrimental reliance

- 任何承诺（例如，未来赠与的承诺），如果：(1)允诺人应合理预期受诺人会信赖该承诺;(2)受诺人因信赖该承诺而遭受损害 并且;(3)只有强制执行该承诺才能避免不公正.
- 不要求证明受诺人的信赖为允诺人带来了经济利益。
- 不要求所承诺的赠与价值必须与受诺人因信赖而遭受的损失大致相当。但是，受诺人的救济仅限于因信赖承诺而遭受的实际损失——而不必然是承诺的全部价值。

# 5.单方合同

## 5.1 gift

- 赠与的承诺通常是不可强制执行的;
- 慈善捐款承诺（charitable subscription）.

> A promise to make a gift is generally unenforceable because it does not involve the bargained-for consideration required to form a valid contract. 
> However, most courts will enforce a charitable subscription , which is a promise to contribute money or property to a charitable institution. They typically do so on promissory estoppel grounds.

## 5.2 Advertisements

- 广告通常被认为是旨在订立合同的要约邀请，而非要约。
- 如果广告满足以下条件，则可以构成一般要约：（1）明确了标的物、数量和价格，并且（2）对可以承诺该要约的人设置了合理的限制。比如:All counches sold for $500 each!,members only!

> Advertisements are generally considered invitations to negotiate or solicitations of offers, which create no power of acceptance in the recipient. However, an advertisement can constitute a general offer - the acceptance of which creates a binding contract - if the advertisement :specifies the subject matter, quantity, and price and places a reasonable limit on who can accept the offer.

# 6.mutual assent

- 合同成立需要双方合意（即要约与承诺），当双方客观地表达了他们达成一项有约束力协议的同意时，合同即告成立；
- 一方的实际意图,比如开玩笑（intend intent），都inrrelevant.

> Contract formation requires mutual assent (ie, offer and acceptance). During the negotiation process, the parties are entitled to rely on a reasonable interpretation of each other's words and actions since they cannot know each other's subjective intent. This means that a contract is formed when both parties objectively express their assent to enter a binding agreement. Once formed, the contract cannot be rescinded because of one party's secret intent not to be bound.

# 二、合同的有效性 & 可执行性

# 1.Preexisting Duty Rule[已经存在的法律义务]

- 在普通法下，合同修改需要新的对价 (consideration)，即每一方当事人都必须以某种方式变更其义务；
- 但是，履行或承诺履行一项已存义务 (preexisting duty) 不构成对价，并且不能支持构成对合同的修改；
- UCC下合同的修改则不需要新的对价，只要求双方协议+善意（诚实并遵守合理的商业公平交易标准）。

> Contract modifications require new consideration - ie, each party must alter his/her duties in some way. But a promise to perform, or the performance of, a preexisting duty does not constitute consideration.

## 1.1  例外
| 主要规则 | 履行已存义务的承诺（或履行本身）不构成对价 |
| ---- | ---- |
| New or Altered Consideration[新的/变更的对价] | If the duty is altered in some way (e.g., different performance or added obligation), then it is valid consideration.[增加新义务或变更既存义务（例如，提前到期日）] |
| Ratification of Voidable Duty[对可撤销义务的追认] | A party re-promising to perform a duty that was previously voidable (e.g., a contract made while underage) is enforceable if ratified after the barrier (e.g., infancy) is removed.[履行可撤销义务的新承诺（例如，达到法定成年年龄时）] | 
| 普通法例外 | （1）善意争议，对义务范围存在善意争议；（2）意外事件，鉴于不可预见的情况而进行的公平合理的修改；（3）重新承诺，尽管存在技术性抗辩（如诉讼时效、破产），但以书面或部分履行的方式重新承诺支付已存债务；（4）第三方，对第三方（即非本案合同当事人）负有的已存义务 |
| UCC例外 | 修改 出于善意寻求的修改——即诚实并遵守公平交易的合理商业标准 | 

### (1) Common Law Exceptions

#### (1.1) Honest Dispute[善意争议]

- If the scope of the duty is honestly disputed, a new promise may be supported by consideration.[义务范围存在善意争议]

> Example: “I don’t think I agreed to paint the garage. But I’ll do it for an extra $500.” → Valid if there’s an honest dispute.

#### (1.2) Unanticipated Circumstances[意外事件]

- If unanticipated events occur and the parties fairly and equitably modify the contract in good faith, the modification may be enforced without new consideration.

> Example: Unexpected labor shortage increases construction cost. Parties agree to pay more. If fair → valid modification.

#### (1.3) Renewed Promise[续新承诺]

- A debtor renews a promise to pay a debt that is barred by a technical defense (like the statute of limitations or bankruptcy).[尽管存在技术性抗辩（例如，诉讼时效、破产），但对既存债务作出新的偿付承诺，且该承诺为书面或已部分履行]

> Example: Debtor writes, “I know I owe you money and I’ll pay it next month,” even though the statute of limitations expired → that written promise revives the obligation.

#### (1.4) Third Party Promise

- If a party promises to do something they already owe to someone else, and a third party offers a benefit for that same act, the promise can be valid consideration.[对第三方（即非本案合同当事方）负有的既存义务]

> Example: A owes B a duty. C offers A $500 to fulfill that duty to B. A’s promise to C is supported by consideration.

# 2.mental inllness

> Mental capacity so deficient that party cannot reasonably understand (or act in relation to) nature or consequences of contract AND other party had reason to know

- Voidable[可撤销的] if disaffirmed by incapacitated party when lucid[清醒的] or by legal representative.

# 3.intoxication [醉酒（或吸毒、麻醉、被药物影响）]

> Party too intoxicated to reasonably understand (or act in relation to) nature or consequences of contract AND other party had reason to know

- Voidable[可撤销的] if promptly disaffirmed by intoxicated party upon becoming sober.
- Intoxicated party must offer to return any consideration received & may be liable for fair value of goods or services provided

# 4.Statute of Fraud/SOF [反欺诈法]

| / | meaning | common law | UCC |
| --- | --- | --- | ---- |
| writing |  Physical or electronic document(s) containing reasonable basis to believe contract was formed (eg, receipt, check, emails) | identifies parties, subject matter, consideration, time & nature of performance | lists quantity of goods (contract enforceable only up to written quantity) |
| signature | / | General rule – handwritten signature from, or other mark identifying, party to be charged[只要求被告签名] (eg, letterhead, electronic signature, initials[简签]) | Merchant exception – a written confirmation need only to be **signed by one merhant** and sent to the other merchant.If the recipient has reason to know the confirmation's contents and does not object within 10 days,then it is **enforceable against both merchants.** [提出反对的书面形式必须有签名,UCC的特殊规定] |

- 根据防止欺诈法 (statute of frauds)，某些类型的合同修改必须采用书面形式，并由被请求强制执行的一方签署。

## 4.1 Marriage

- a contract made in consideration of marriage.

## 4.2 Year

- a contract that cannot be completed within one year.[从签订日期开始预计要超过一年才能完成的服务合同]
- Contracts whose terms make it impossible for any party to fully perform within one year,Excludes contracts of uncertain duration[时间不确定的合同] (eg, lifetime contracts).

> The one-year provision of the statute of frauds applies to a contract whose terms make it impossible for any party to fully perform within one year. However, the parties' option to terminate the contract within a year does not remove it from the statute under the majority rule.

## 4.3 Land

- a contract for the sale or transfer of an interest in real property.
- leases and easements[租约和地役权] for less than one year are usually excluded from the statute，even though it involves an interest in real property.

> a contract for the sale of land that violates this statute may still be enforceable if the part-performance exception applies. This requires proof that the buyer has done at least **two** of the following:

- Taken **possession** of the property (as the stable manager did here)
- Made **substantial improvements** to the property (not seen here)
- **Paid** some or all of the **purchase price** (here, the stable manager made a small down payment)

## 4.4 Executor

– a contract to pay an estate's debt out of the executor's personal funds[遗产管理人自掏腰包支付死者的债务]

## 4.5 Goods

- a contract for the sale of goods for $500 or more[500美金或以上的物品买卖合同]
- UCC下只要数量确定，the contract is enforceable since UCC gap-fillers will supply the price term at the time of delivery.***Under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) § 2-201, contracts for the sale of goods worth $500 or more must be in writing to be enforceable.***

## 4.6 Suretyship[保证合同]

### (1)保证人一般因其承诺获得报酬

> A suretyship arises when one party (guarantor,保证人) promises a second party (creditor，债权人) that the guarantor will pay the debt of a third party (principal，主债务人) if he/she defaults[违约]. To be enforceable, a suretyship must be in writing and supported by consideration. The consideration requirement is met if the guarantor is compensated for the promise.

### （2）例外:保证人未获报酬

- 1.the creditor conditioned the loan to the principal on the guarantor's promise to pay[债权人向主债务人提供贷款的条件是保证人承诺偿还] or
- 2.the guarantor made the promise to pay before or at the same time as the creditor made the loan to the principal.[保证人在债权人向主债务人提供贷款之前或同时作出了偿还承诺]

> In either case, the loan itself serves as valid consideration for the guarantor's promise[贷款本身即构成了对保证人承诺的有效对价] - even if the guarantor is not notified when the loan is made. That is because the loan is a legal detriment[法律上的损害] to the creditor that was induced by the guarantor's promise.

## 4.7 合同的非书面修改

### （1）合同对修改未作规定

- 非书面修改有效，除非适用反欺诈法（普通法 & UCC）

### （2）NOM clause[no-oral modification clause]

#### （2.1）普通法：NOM一般无效

- 条款不可执行。非书面修改有效，除非适用反欺诈法；
- 普通法下，只要修改有对价，即便是口头也可以修改书面合同，NOM条款通常是无效。

> Modifications to a contract that falls within and satisfies this statute generally need not be in writing because the enforceability of the initial contract passes to any modifications.

#### （2.2）UCC：NOM默认有效

- 条款可执行（即非书面修改无效），即禁止口头修改条款；
- 对于单独签署该条款的非商人通常是可执行的;
- 以下情况下，这些条款被视为放弃：(1)双方试图通过口头或其行为（例如，提出并接受替代履行）来修改合同，并且(2)一方基于对该修改的信赖而实质性地改变了他/她的处境;
- 在这种情况下，试图进行的修改是有效的。并且，如果任何一方违反或终止修改后的合同，另一方有权获得补偿性损害赔偿。

# 5.incapacity due to infancy

- By statute in some jurisdictions, certain contracts entered by a minor (eg, student loanagreements, insurance contracts) are not voidable by the minor but instead are fullyenforceable by the other contracting party.

> Unmarried, unemancipated minors (ie, persons under the age of 18) lack capacity to contract because of their infancy. As a result, any contract entered by a minor is voidable by the minor.This means that the minor can either：
***void*** the contract before or soon after turning 18 by (1) disaffirming the contract through words or actions and (2) returning any still-existing benefit received under the contract or
***ratify*** the contract after turning 18 by (1) failing to timely void the contract or (2) otherwise agreeing to be bound by it—eg, by attempting to render performance of or payment under the contract.

|阶段|情形|合同效力|
| -- | -- | -- |
| if minor,before or soon after turning 18 | disaffirms contract | voided[无效] |
| if minor,before or soon after turning 18 | returns any still-existing benefit received under contract | voided |
| if minor,after turning 18 | fails to timely void contract | ratified |
| if minor,after turning 18 | agrees to be bound by contract | ratified |
| if contract is for necessitites(food,clothing,medicine) | disaffirm contract but must pay value of benefits received | exception |

# 三、合同的修改

# 1.合同瑕疵汇总

|情形|结果|
| -- | -- |
| misunderstanding | 没有合同、没有合意，无效 (void) |
| 胁迫（duress） | 没有合同、没有合意，无效 (void) |
| 以违法（illegal）、违反公序良俗（contrary to public policy）为直接目的 | 没有合同、没有合意，无效 (void) |
| 被监护人接管的精神病人签订的合同 | 没有合同、没有合意，无效 (void) |
|没有对价、虚无的对价| 无法执行（unenforceable）|
| 违反反欺诈 | 无法执行（unenforceable）|
| 不合情理（unconscionable）| 无法执行（unenforceable）|
| 共同误解（mutual mistake）| 可撤销 （voidable）|
| 欺诈、虚假陈述、隐瞒重要事实 | 可撤销 （voidable）|
| 未成年签订的合同 | 可撤销 （voidable）|
| 被酒精（药物）影响，对方明知或应知 | 可撤销 （voidable）|
|间歇性精神病发作期间签订的合同 | 可撤销 （voidable）|
| 非直接武力胁迫以外的不当威胁 | 可撤销 （voidable）|
| 不当影响（undue influence）| 可撤销 （voidable）|
| 合同本身不违法，但被用作违法意图 | 可撤销 （voidable）|

# 2.misunderstanding[条款理解不同]

| / | general rule | waiver |
| -- | -- | -- |
| neither/both parties know of misunderstanding | no contract formed[合同没有成立] | either party can enforce **other party’s** understanding |
| One party knows of misunderstanding | Contract formed based on unknowing party's understanding[如果一方知道对方的想法，合同按照对方所想成立] | Unknowing party can enforce knowing party's understanding |

- It occurs when the parties to a contract attach **different meanings** to the **same term**. If the misunderstanding involves a **material term**, most often there is no contract because there is no meeting of the minds.But if **one party knows or has reason to know about the misunderstanding**, then a valid contract will be formed based on the meaning of the **term as understood** by the **unknowing party**.

- Trade usage can be used to show that a word or phrase has a particular meaning—eg, that "daily service" does not include Sundays in the commercial laundry business. But trade usage will not control when a party knows that the other party attaches a different meaning to the term.

- When one party to a contract knows or has reason to know that the other party attaches a different meaning to a material term, then the unknowing party's meaning of the term will control.

# 3.mistake [事实认识错误]

## 3.1 unilateral mistake[单方面的事实认识错误]

## 3.2 mutual mistake [共同误解]

> When both parties enter a contract based on the same mistake (ie, mutual mistake), the contract is voidable by the adversely affected party if[受影响的一方可以撤销合同]:
the mistake relates to a **basic assumption** of the contract
the mistake **materially affects** the agreed-upon exchange of performances (ie, the adversely affected party cannot fairly be required to carry it out) and
the adversely affected party does not assume the risk of the mistake.（ie，the agreement did not expressly allocate the risk of the mistake）.

## 3.3 allocate the risk

- A court can allocate the risk of a mistake—ie, an erroneous belief of fact held by one or both parties—to a party upon a finding that it is reasonable in the circumstances to do so (eg, based on that party's culpability). 

- But a court cannot allocate the risk of a misunderstanding—ie, the attachment of different meanings to the same term.

# 4.undue influence[不当影响]

- A contract is voidable for undue influence if a party's assent[同意] was the product of unfair or excessive persuasion by someone who dominate[支配] or shared a special relationship[特殊关系] of trust and confidence with that party.

> Persuasion is unfair or excessive if it seriously impairs the assenting party's ability to exercise free and competent judgment. The following factors are relevant to making this determination:
Susceptibility of the assenting party (eg, elderly, in poor health).
Unfairness of the resulting bargain (eg, sale of business for less than half its market value).
Unavailability of independent advice (eg, attorney unavailable to discuss sale).

uld be expected to observe it.

# 5.unconscionable[不合情理的]

> The defense of unconscionability is available when a contract's bargaining process and/or the contract terms were so unfair to one party that no reasonable person would have agreed to it. When this occurs, the court can **modify or cancel** (ie, refuse to enforce) the contract. Factors used to determine whether a contract is unconscionable include:
sophistication and knowledge of each party (eg, the parties' unequal knowledge of the timber industry[木材行业])
disparity between the parties' bargaining power[除了接受不合理条款别无选择] (eg, the landowner is money-poor and the logger is the only potential buyer)
disparity between the value of consideration exchanged by the parties (eg, the sale of timber rights on choice land for a price that is significantly lower than the prevailing rate) and
one-sidedness of contract terms (eg, the contract terms overwhelmingly favor the logger).

# 6.misrepresentation[虚假陈述]

## 6.1 When disclosure is required to avoid misrepresentation

| / | required |
| ------ | ------ |
| Previous assertion | Disclosure would prevent previous assertion from being a misrepresentation or fraudulent or material |
| Mistake about basic assumption | (1)Disclosure would correct other party's mistake about basic assumption of contract + (2) Failure to disclose would constitute lack of good faith & fair dealing |
| Fiduciary[信托] relationship | Other party is entitled to know fact because of confidential/fiduciary relationship |
| Mistake about writing | Disclosure would correct other party's mistake about contents or effect of writing that embodies agreement |

### （1）合同可撤销的条件[仅受合同不利影响的一方]

- [欺诈的方式作出]The misrepresentation was fraudulent[欺诈性的](ie, made knowingly[故意] or recklessly with the intent to induce the other party's assent to the contract) OR material (ie, likely to induce a reasonable person's assent).

- [导致了对方同意合同]The misrepresentation induced assent to the contract.

- [受不利影响的一方有理由依赖虚假陈述]The adversely affected party justifiably relied on the misrepresentation.

# 7.illegal/contrary to public policy[违反公序良俗] contract 

- 如果合同本身并不违法，只是被用于非法目的，且一方事先并不知情合同并不会无效。哪怕知情，只要1. 没有进一步促进违法行为，并且2. 非法目的不会造成严重的社会伤害，比如人身安全的威胁。依然可以要求另一方**履行合同**，或者**赔偿不履行合同带来的损害**。

> An illegal contract generally is void and there is no remedy for a breach. However, in limited situations, a party to an illegal contract can recover either ***expectation damages*** (eg, if the party was justifiably ignorant of the illegality) OR ***restitution damages*** (eg, if the party was less culpable than the other party).

## 7.1 救济

| Recovery |  cause  |
| -----  | ---- |
| expectation damages(full value of lost performance) |  (1)Party justifiably ignorant of illegality |
| expectation damages(full value of lost performance) |  (2)Party substantially performed & lacked illegal purpose |
| expectation damages(full value of lost performance)|  (3)Contract separable into legal / illegal parts or |
| expectation damage(full value of lost performance) |  (4)Contract illegal due to violation of licensing requirement designed only to raise revenue |
| Restitution damages (reasonable value of benefit conferred)| Party justifiably ignorant of illegality |
| Restitution damages (reasonable value of benefit conferred)| Party less culpable than other party or |
| Restitution damages (reasonable value of benefit conferred)| Party withdrew before illegal purpose achieved & did not engage in serious misconduct |

### （1）expectation damages

- It can recover full vaule of lost performance.An illegal contract is enforceable for the full amount of the nonbreaching party's expectation damages if:

### （2）restitution damages[衡平法的救济,不当得利的返还]

- It can recover reasonable value of benefit conferred.A party to an illegal contract can recover such damages if that party conferred a benefit on the other party and:

## 7.2 履行

- When a contract violates a law that was designed to protect the party seeking to enforce the contract, the contract can be enforced to avoid frustrating the public policy behind the statute.

# 8.Modifying existing contracts[对现有合同的修改]

| governing law | requirements |
| ---- | ---- |
| common law | （1）传统观点：双方协议 + 新的对价；（2）现代观点：双方协议 + 新的对价，除非因未预见情况导致的变更是公平合理的  |
| UCC | （1）双方协议 + 善意（即，诚实并遵守合理的商业公平交易标准）Parties' agreement Good faith (ie, honesty & observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing)
(2)不需要新的对价.New consideration not required |

- 在普通法下，合同变更通常需要一个新的有对价的交换，该交换以某种方式改变了双方的义务（即新的对价）。然而，在没有新的对价的情况下，如果合同变更满足以下条件，仍然可以强制执行：（1）基于双方在订立合同时未预料到的情况，并且（2）根据这些情况，变更是公平合理的。
- UCC允许在没有对价的情况下进行变更，只要该变更是基于善意提出的。善意要求诚实并遵守合理的商业公平交易标准。如果任何一方未能履行其在变更后合同下的义务，那么另一方可以因违约而要求赔偿。

> At common law, contract modification generally requires a new bargained-for exchange that alters the duties of both parties in some way (ie, new consideration).
> the UCC, which deals expressly with the sale of goods, allows modifications without consideration so long as they are sought in good faith. Good faith requires honesty and observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing. And if either party fails to perform his/her obligations under the modified contract, then the other party can recover for breach.

# 四、合同的解释

# 1.Rules of contract interpretation[文义解释]

- The plain-meaning rule of contract interpretation instructs courts to rely on the ordinary meaning of the words if the contract's language is clear and unambiguous.
- Evidence used to clarify the meaning of an ambiguous contract term is **excepted from the parol evidence rule**.

|rule|Court's interpret|
| ------ | ------ |
| Plain-meaning rule | Court interprets contract terms according to their plain meaning(unless parties clearly intended specialized meaning) |
| Plain-meaning rule | Goal is to effectuate parties' outward expressions of intent |
| Plain-meaning rule | Extrinsic evidence may be used to clarify ambiguous or overlyvague terms |
| Context rule | Court interprets contract terms by considering all facts &circumstances related to transaction |
| Context rule | (some courts)Goal is to effectuate parties' actual intent |

# 2.contra proferentem[不利解释原则]

- 合同有歧义（ambiguous）时，以对起草方不利的解释为原则。但是，当有履约习惯、交易习惯、行业惯例存在时，我们认为合同是没有歧义的（unambiguous）.Under the doctrine of contra proferentem, ambiguous contract terms are interpreted against the drafter to protect the rights of the nondrafter. But this doctrine does not apply when, as here, the terms are unambiguous.

> Contra proferentem is a legal principle used in contract interpretation. It means that if there is any ambiguity in a contract, the interpretation should be made against the party that drafted the contract. This rule helps protect the weaker or non-drafting party, ensuring that the drafter does not benefit from unclear language.

# 3.course of performance[履约习惯]/course of dealing[交易习惯]/trade usage[行业惯例]

| 解释规则 | 要件 |
| --- | ---- |
| Course of performance |Sequence of conduct that is relevant to understanding agreement between parties if:（1）agreement involves repeated occasions for performance by one party & （2）other party accepts performance without objection |
| Course of dealing | Sequence of conduct concerning previous transactions between parties that establishes common basis of understanding for interpreting their conduct |
| Trade usage | Practice or method of dealing in parties' business or industry that is observed with enough regularity to justify expectation that it will be observed in instant case |

## 3.1 不受口头证据规则的限制

- 如果合同有明确规定，应该以合同规定为准，不应该适用这些习惯。
- UCC进一步认为，这些交易习惯证据可以用来补充和解释一个合同而不受口头证据限制，即使合同是完备的.

> Under the UCC parol evidence rule, evidence of a prior agreement (or contemporaneous oral agreement) cannot be used to contradict the terms of a final written agreement. But evidence of the parties' course of performance, the parties' course of dealing, or trade usage can always be used to explain or supplement those terms.

## 3.2 如存在内容的冲突，适用的先后顺位

- If the evidence is inconsistent, priority is given as follows:
• Express terms[明示条款] prevail over all others
• Course of performance[履约习惯] prevails over course of dealing and trade usagep
• Course of dealing [交易习惯] prevails over trade usage

# 4.The parol evidence rule [口头证据规则]

|type|definition|effect|
| -- | -- | --- |
| Complete integration[完备的合同] | Writing that sets forth parties' final agreement about all terms，常见：merger clause[完备条款]，all matters | （1）Excludes parol evidence within scope of agreement；（2）Parol evidence **inadmissible** to supplement (ie, add to) or contradict contract |
| Partial integration[不完备的合同] | Writing that sets forth parties' final agreement about some terms | （1）Excludes parol evidence inconsistent with agreement；（2）Parol evidence **admissible** to supplement (not contradict不抵触) contract |

## 4.1 合同以书面为准

- 排除与书面合同相矛盾的证据;
- 不禁止关于双方当事人之间后续协议的证据（例如，双方在合同签订后就“额外项目”达成的口头修改）

> The parol evidence rule generally prevents a party to a written contract from presenting evidence of a prior or contemporaneous agreement that contradicts the terms of the contract as written[签约之前的口头或书面沟通如果和正式的书面合同原文抵触则无法使用]. But this rule does not bar evidence of subsequent agreements between the parties (eg, the parties' oral modifications regarding "extras" that occurred after the contract was entered) .
> Even when a contract is completely integrated (eg, as evidenced by a merger clause), the parol evidence rule does not bar evidence to clarify the meaning of an ambiguous contract term.
> The UCC parol evidence rule bars evidence of any prior agreement (or contemporaneous[同时发生的] oral agreement) that contradicts the terms of an integrated writing.***U.C.C. § 2-202 (Am. Law Inst. & Unif. Law Comm'n 2020) (parol evidence rule).***

## 4.2 口头证据规则的例外

### （1）consistent additional terms/collateral agreement [附属条款]

- 根据普通法 ，如果考虑到协议的上下文，一致的附加条款似乎很自然地被遗漏，则该条款可能是可以接受的。Under Common Law, consistent additional terms might be admissible if it seems natural that the term would have been left out given the context of the agreement.
- 根据 UCC，重点是附加条款是否足够重要，以至于如果商定的话肯定会包含在合同中。Under the UCC, the focus is on whether the additional term is important enough that it would certainly have been included in the contract if it had been agreed upon.

> This rule does not apply when such evidence is offered to prove the existence of a collateral agreement—ie, a separate contract supported by separate consideration.

### （2）conditions[合同条件]

- 比如是为了证明合同只会在某个条件下才会生效（condition precedent），可以引入。

> The parol evidence rule does not apply when a party is attacking the validity[有效性] of the agreement—eg, by asserting there was a condition precedent to effectiveness that failed to occur. As a result, evidence of such a condition precedent is admissible.

### （3）reformation[合同重写]

- 因双方共同的原因不慎导致双方约定的内容和正式的合同有差异，一方可以要求重写合同。

### （4）合同效力的例外

- 签约之前的沟通如果是为了证明合同无效、可撤销、无法执行等效力问题，可以引入。这些沟通还可以用来证明合同是否完备（completely/fully integrated）。

> However, this rule does not apply, and such evidence is always admissible, when the evidence is used to determine remedies for breach. For example, parol evidence is admissible to prove that ***consequential damages*** were foreseeable and are therefore recoverable.

# 五、 合同的履行

# 1.预期违约[Anticipatory breach] & 不安抗辩[anticipatory repudiation]

- 如果对方明确表示即将违约（anticipatory repudiation），则受影响的一方可以：1. 立刻起诉违约，或者等履约期满起诉，2. 免除合同的履行责任，3. 敦促对方履行。
- 一方可以撤回自己此前即将违约的声明，除非：1. 另外一方基于对即将违约的声明的信赖已经作出安排，2. 另外一方已经明确接受了即将违约的声明，或者3. 另外一方已经提起了违约的诉讼。
- 如果有理由相信对方无法履行合同，受影响的一方可以书面要求对方在合理时间内提供履约保证，如果不能按时提供保证，可以视为即将违约。需要注意的是：1. 必须有合理的原因，基于善意，相信对方无法履行合同，2. 必须书面给出合理期限让对方提出担保，如果没有注明期限，UCC的规定是30天，3. 不能提出明显不合理的担保要求。

> Anticipatory breach* occurs when one party communicates to the other party that it will not perform under the contract. The other party can treat this as a breach and sue immediately or demand performance.

# 2.和解清偿协议（accord）

# 六、合同与第三人

| Type of provision | Explicit prohibitions[明确禁止] | Assignment of rights | Delegation of duties |
| ------ | ------ | ---- | ----- |
| None | N/A | Allowed |     |
| Specific | Assignment of rights & delegation of duties | Barred |    |
| Specific | Assignment of rights only | Barred |  Allowed |
| Specific | Delegation of duties only | Allowed | Barred |  
| General | Assignment of "the contract" |   |    |

# 1.special clause

## 1.1 Nonassignment provisions

- 普通法中，合同的权利默认都是可以转让的（assignment of rights），***不需要经过另一方同意***。甚至合同仅仅是禁止转让（no assignment of the contract），禁止的也只是义务的转让而不是权利的转让。只有合同明确禁止转让权利（no assignment of rights），转让方（assignor）才禁止转让权利。
- Nonassignment provisions are enforceable.

> Since the nonassignment provision (this contract may not be assigned") did not specify whether it applied to rights or duties, it will be construed to mean that duties may not be delegated.Unless the contract states otherwise, contractual duties can be delegated without the promisee's express consent.

## 1.2 Silent as to assignment

> "Silent as to assignment" means that a contract or legal document does not include any provisions addressing whether rights or obligations under the agreement can be assigned to another party. When a contract is silent on assignment, the default legal rule in the relevant jurisdiction typically applies.
> In many cases, unless there is a specific prohibition, contract rights are generally assignable, but **obligations usually require the consent of the other party before being transferred**. However, the exact implications depend on the governing law of the contract.

# 2.delegate[义务转让]

> Contractual **duties** can be delegated by a party (ie, the promisor) to a nonparty (ie, the delegatee). An assignment of the entire contract will be construed as an assignment of rights and a delegation of duties. But even after a delegation of duties, the **promisor remains liable** for breach if the delegatee fails to perform—unless the promisee agrees to release the promisor from his/her duties.

## 2.1 禁止转让义务的情形

### （1）合同明确禁止assignment或者禁止delegation

> delegation is prohibited by contract

### （2）需要特殊技能的服务合同显然也不适合转让

> other contracting party has substantial interest in having delegating party perform (eg, in personal-services contract involving taste or special skill，比如设计)

# 3.assignment[权利转让]

> [普通法中权利默认是可以转让的]An assignment is the transfer of **rights** under a contract to another (ie, assignee). The assignee takes all of the rights of the assignor as the contract stands at the time of the assignment.

## 3.1 exceptions

- materially increases obligor's contractual duties or risks.
- materially reduces obligor's chance of obtaining performance.
- is void (not merely prohibited) under contract provision[根据合同条款无效]

## 3.2 Consideration generally required to make assignment irrevocable[不可撤销]

- If one party in an agreement decides to waive or forgive a condition (a requirement that must be met for the contract to be fully enforced) for a specific performance or act, they still have the right to reinstate or re-enforce that condition for any future actions or performances under the agreement. However, that rule is **not applicable** here because the parties modified the contract by mutual agreement and the opportunity to reinstate a condition was no longer available.
- there was **consideration** for the creditor's promise to accept payment at a later date (and the modification was effective) because the debtor altered his preexisting duty to pay the debt by promising to make future payments by cashier's check.
- Exceptions: promissory estoppel, delivery of document symbolizing assigned right (eg, stock certificate), delivery of written & signed assignment.
- There is no rule that makes a contract modification ineffective as to an assignee simply because the assignee had no **notice** of it.

## 3.3 Assignee's rights

- accrued before obligor received notice of assignment.
- stem from assignor's present or future failure to perform.
- Assignor loses rights & therefore cannot enforce contract.

> A party to a contract is generally free to assign (ie, transfer) its contractual rights to another. The recipient of those rights (assignee) then steps into the shoes of the assigning party (assignor) and assumes all of the assignor's contractual rights to the obligor's performance as they stand at the time of the assignment. However, those rights are subject to any claims or defenses that:

# 4.novation [约务更替]

## 4.1 promisee's recovery for breach after promisor delegated dutites

- 约务更替（novation）与义务的转让（delegation）非常类似，但有本质不同。转让通常不需要合同的另一方同意，约务更替则是三方重新签署一个新的合同完全替代此前的双方合同。在约务更替理论下，原本的合同权利和义务不复存在。
- 约务更替是以一个新当事方替代原当事方之一的新合同。

|约定形式|vs promisor|vs delegatee|
| -- | -- | -- |
| informal delegation | yes | no |
| contractual delegation | yes | yes |
| contractual delegation + release(ie,novation) | no | yes |

## 4.2 区别

- 约务更替和和解清偿协议（accord and satisfaction）也有较大的区别：约务更替引入了第三方，也不用考虑对价理论。

| 名称 | 同意 | 对价 | 原合同 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 义务转让 delegation | 单方 | 既有对价 | 存在 |
| 和解清偿协议 accord | 双方 | 需要 | 存在（暂停执行，并没有废除原来的合同，只是暂停原来合同的执行。如果义务方违约，权利方既可以执行原合同，也可以执行和解清偿协议）|
| 约务更替 novation | 三方 | 不需要 | 被替代 |

# 5.A third-party beneficiary[受益第三人]

> A third-party beneficiary is a nonparty to a contract who receives an advantage or benefit from the contract.

## 5.1 intended beneficiary [故意受益第三人]

- The third party can enforce the contract if the third party is an intended beneficiary (ie, one whom the contracting parties intended to benefit directly).
- An intended beneficiary does not need to rely on the doctrine of promissory estoppel[承诺性禁反言]—which allows a party to enforce a promise on which it relied when no valid contract was formed—to enforce its rights.

> Receive direct benefit from contract because contracting parties intended to benefit them.

## 5.2 incidental beneficiary[附带受益第三人]

> Receive indirect benefit from contract even though there was no contractual intent to benefit them.

# 七、违约

# 八、普通法救济

# 九、衡平法救济

# 1. Promissory estoppel

- 如果一方作出承诺，对方已经基于信赖作出有损害的安排（detrimental reliance），则承诺方不得反悔。
- 基于信赖作出的安排必须是有损害的（detrimental）

## 1.1 强制执行另一方允诺的条件

- 1.promisor reasonably expected to induce reliance on promise[允诺人合理预期其允诺会引致信赖]
- 2.enforcing party reasonably relied on promise[寻求强制执行的一方合理地信赖了该允诺]
- 3.reliance caused enforcing party to suffer substantial detriment[重大损害] and 
- 4.injustice can be avoided only by enforcing promise[只有通过执行该允诺才能避免不公].

## 1.2 要约被视为选择权合同，因此在一段合理时间内是不可撤销的

- 1.the offeror reasonably expected to induce reliance on the offer before acceptance.[要约人合理预期其要约在被接受前会引致信赖]
- 2.the offeree reasonably relied on the offer and that reliance caused the offeree to suffer substantial detriment.[受要约人合理地信赖了该要约并且该信赖导致受要约人遭受了重大的不利影响]

# 十、Employment contracts

## 1. indefinite or permanent duration

> A contract to employ someone for an indefinite or permanent duration typically creates an **at-will employment** relationship. An at-will employment relationship allows either party to terminate the employment contract at any time and for any reason unless the termination violates public policy - eg, when an employee is discharged[解雇] for filing a discrimination claim.

## 2.definite duration

- Termination allowed only for cause or by mutual agreement.
