# 一、合同的形成

# 二、合同的有效性 & 可执行性

# 1.incapacity due to infancy

> Unmarried, unemancipated minors (ie, persons under the age of 18) lack capacity to contract because of their infancy. As a result, any contract entered by a minor is voidable by the minor.This means that the minor can either：

- ***void*** the contract before or soon after turning 18 by (1) disaffirming the contract through words or actions and (2) returning any still-existing benefit received under the contract or

- ***ratify*** the contract after turning 18 by (1) failing to timely void the contract or (2) otherwise agreeing to be bound by it—eg, by attempting to render performance of or payment under the contract.

> By statute in some jurisdictions, certain contracts entered by a minor (eg, student loanagreements, insurance contracts) are not voidable by the minor but instead are fullyenforceable by the other contracting party.

|阶段|情形|合同效力|
| -- | -- | -- |
| if minor,before or soon after turning 18 | disaffirms contract | voided[无效] |
| if minor,before or soon after turning 18 | returns any still-existing benefit received under contract | voided |
| if minor,after turning 18 | fails to timely void contract | ratified |
| if minor,after turning 18 | agrees to be bound by contract | ratified |
| if contract is for necessitites(food,clothing,medicine) | disaffirm contract but must pay value of benefits received | exception | 

## 2.mental inllness

> Mental capacity so deficient that party cannot reasonably understand (or act in relation to) nature or consequences of contract AND other party had reason to know

- Voidable[可撤销的] if disaffirmed by incapacitated party when lucid[清醒的] or by legal representative.

## 3.intoxication [醉酒（或吸毒、麻醉、被药物影响）]

> Party too intoxicated to reasonably understand (or act in relation to) nature or consequences of contract AND other party had reason to know

- Voidable[可撤销的] if promptly disaffirmed by intoxicated party upon becoming sober.

- Intoxicated party must offer to return any consideration received & may be liable for fair value of goods or services provided

## 4.Statute of Fraud/SOF [反欺诈法]

| / | meaning | common law | UCC |
| --- | --- | --- | ---- |
| writing |  Physical or electronic document(s) containing reasonable basis to believe contract was formed (eg, receipt, check, emails) | identifies parties, subject matter, consideration, time & nature of performance | lists quantity of goods (contract enforceable only up to written quantity) |x
| signature | General rule – handwritten signature from, or other mark identifying, party to be charged[只要求被告签名] (eg, letterhead, electronic signature, initials[简签]) | Merchant exception – between merchants, written confirmation that satisfies statute of frauds as to sender will bind both parties if no written objection[提出反对的书面形式必须有签名] within 10 days[UCC的特殊规定] |

### 4.1 适用反欺诈法的情形/特殊合同必须要书面

> A contract need only be in writing and signed by the party to be charged if it falls within the statute of frauds. This rule applies to contracts for the sale of goods for $500 or more.

#### （1）500美金或以上的物品买卖合同

- [UCC下只要数量确定]，the contract is enforceable since UCC gap-fillers will supply the price term at the time of delivery.

- Under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) § 2-201, contracts for the sale of goods worth $500 or more must be in writing to be enforceable.

#### （2）房地产合同

#### （3）婚前或婚内协议，不包括承诺要结婚的合同

#### （4）从签订日期开始预计要超过一年才能完成的服务合同

#### （5）担保合同

#### （6）遗产管理人自掏腰包支付死者的债务

### 4.2 merchant exception[UCC]

> Under the merchant exception, a written confirmation need only be **signed by one merchant** and sent to the other merchant. If the recipient has reason to know the confirmation's contents and does not object within 10 days, then it is **enforceable against both merchants**.

- the baker and the supplier are both merchants—regular dealers in flour. The baker's signed note was a sufficient writing because it confirmed that a contract was formed and listed the quantity of goods sold. Additionally, the supplier had reason to know the contents of the note (received and read it) and did not object within 10 days. Therefore, the contract was enforceable against both parties.

# 三、合同的修改

## 1.合同瑕疵汇总

|情形|结果|
| -- | -- |
| misunderstanding | 没有合同、没有合意(void) |
| 胁迫（duress） | 没有合同、没有合意(void) |
| 以违法（illegal）、违反公序良俗（contrary to public policy）为直接目的 | 没有合同、没有合意(void) |
| 被监护人接管的精神病人签订的合同 | 没有合同、没有合意(void) |
|没有对价、虚无的对价| 无法执行（unenforceable）|
| 违反反欺诈 | 无法执行（unenforceable）|
| 不合情理（unconscionable）| 无法执行（unenforceable）|
| 共同误解（mutual mistake）| 可撤销 （voidable）|
| 欺诈、虚假陈述、隐瞒重要事实 | 可撤销 （voidable）|
| 未成年签订的合同 | 可撤销 （voidable）|

| 不当影响（undue influence）| 可撤销 （voidable）|
| 合同本身不违法，但被用作违法意图 | 可撤销 （voidable）|

## 1.misunderstanding【条款理解不同】

| / | general rule | waiver |
| -- | -- | -- |
| neither/both parties know of misunderstanding | no contract formed[合同没有成立] | either party can enforce **other party’s** understanding |
| One party knows of misunderstanding | Contract formed based on unknowing party's understanding[如果一方知道对方的想法，合同按照对方所想成立] | Unknowing party can enforce knowing party's understanding |

> It occurs when the parties to a contract attach **different meanings** to the **same term**. If the misunderstanding involves a **material term**, most often there is no contract because there is no meeting of the minds.But if **one party knows or has reason to know about the misunderstanding**, then a valid contract will be formed based on the meaning of the **term as understood** by the **unknowing party**.

- Trade usage can be used to show that a word or phrase has a particular meaning—eg, that "daily service" does not include Sundays in the commercial laundry business. But trade usage will not control when a party knows that the other party attaches a different meaning to the term.

- When one party to a contract knows or has reason to know that the other party attaches a different meaning to a material term, then the unknowing party's meaning of the term will control.

## 2.mistake [事实认识错误]

### 2.1 unilateral mistake[单方面的事实认识错误]

### 2.2 mutual mistake [共同误解]

> When both parties enter a contract based on the same mistake (ie, mutual mistake), the contract is voidable by the adversely affected party if[受影响的一方可以撤销合同]:

- the mistake relates to a **basic assumption** of the contract
- the mistake **materially affects** the agreed-upon exchange of performances (ie, the adversely affected party cannot fairly be required to carry it out) and
- the adversely affected party does not assume the risk of the mistake.（ie，the agreement did not expressly allocate the risk of the mistake）.

## 3.allocate the risk

- A court can allocate the risk of a mistake—ie, an erroneous belief of fact held by one or both parties—to a party upon a finding that it is reasonable in the circumstances to do so (eg, based on that party's culpability). 

- But a court cannot allocate the risk of a misunderstanding—ie, the attachment of different meanings to the same term.

## 3.undue influence[不当影响]

> A contract is voidable for undue influence if a party's assent[同意] was the product of unfair or excessive persuasion by someone who dominate[支配] or shared a special relationship[特殊关系] of trust and confidence with that party.
> Persuasion is unfair or excessive if it seriously impairs the assenting party's ability to exercise free and competent judgment. The following factors are relevant to making this determination:

- Susceptibility of the assenting party (eg, elderly, in poor health).
- Unfairness of the resulting bargain (eg, sale of business for less than half its market value).
- Unavailability of independent advice (eg, attorney unavailable to discuss sale).

## 4.The parol evidence rule [口头证据规则]

### 4.1 签约之前的口头/书面沟通+不抵触合同原文

> The parol evidence rule generally bars evidence of a prior oral or written agreement to modify or contradict the terms of a final written agreement. However, parol evidence is admissible to establish an ambiguous term—eg, when a term is subject to a misunderstanding.

- The UCC parol evidence rule bars evidence of any prior agreement (or contemporaneous oral agreement) that contradicts the terms of an integrated writing.***U.C.C. § 2-202 (Am. Law Inst. & Unif. Law Comm'n 2020) (parol evidence rule)***.

|type|definition|effect|
| -- | -- | --- |
| Complete integration[完备的合同] | Writing that sets forth parties' final agreement about all terms，常见：merger clause[完备条款]，all matters | （1）Excludes parol evidence within scope of agreement；（2）Parol evidence **inadmissible** to supplement (ie, add to) or contradict contract |
| Partial integration[不完备的合同] | Writing that sets forth parties' final agreement about some terms | （1）Excludes parol evidence inconsistent with agreement；（2）Parol evidence **admissible** to supplement (not contradict不抵触) contract |

### 4.2 no-oral modification clause/NOM clause

| Rule | enforceable |
| -- | -- |
| common law (contracts for services or real estate) [普通法下，只要修改有对价，即便是口头也可以修改书面合同，NOM条款通常是无效] | NOM clause enforceable only if modification must be in writing under statute of frauds |
| UCC (contracts for sale of goods) [UCC下，NOM默认是有效的] | (1)All parties are merchants – NOM clause always enforceable;(2) > 1 party is nonmerchant – NOM clause in merchant's form must be separately signed by nonmerchant(s) to be enforceabl[非商家需要对NOM条款单独签名]|

- eg:the parties orally agreed to extend the exclusivity period by 60 days. Although the written agreement contained a NOM clause, the modified exclusivity period did not need to be evidenced by a writing since no statute of frauds provision applies. And since there was consideration—60 more days of exclusivity in exchange for 60 more days of service—the parties' oral agreement effectively modified their written agreement.

- The parol evidence rule generally prevents proof of prior or contemporaneous agreements that modify or contradict the terms of a written contract. But this rule does not prevent proof of subsequent agreements between the parties—eg, the oral agreement entered **after** the written listing agreement was executed.

# 四、合同的解释
## 1.Rules of contract interpretation

> The plain-meaning rule of contract interpretation instructs courts to rely on the ordinary meaning of the words if the contract's language is clear and unambiguous.

|rule|Court's interpret|
| ------ | ------ |
| Plain-meaning rule | Court interprets contract terms according to their plain meaning(unless parties clearly intended specialized meaning) |
| Plain-meaning rule | Goal is to effectuate parties' outward expressions of intent |
| Plain-meaning rule | Extrinsic evidence may be used to clarify ambiguous or overlyvague terms |
| Context rule | Court interprets contract terms by considering all facts &circumstances related to transaction |
| Context rule | (some courts)Goal is to effectuate parties' actual intent |

# 3.contra proferentem[不利解释原则]

> Contra proferentem is a legal principle used in contract interpretation. It means that if there is any ambiguity in a contract, the interpretation should be made against the party that drafted the contract. This rule helps protect the weaker or non-drafting party, ensuring that the drafter does not benefit from unclear language.
> Under the doctrine of contra proferentem, ambiguous contract terms are interpreted against the drafter to protect the rights of the nondrafter. But this doctrine does not apply when, as here, the terms are unambiguous.

# 五、 合同的履行

# 六、合同与第三人

## 1.delegate[义务转让]

> Contractual **duties** can be delegated by a party (ie, the promisor) to a nonparty (ie, the delegatee). An assignment of the entire contract will be construed as an assignment of rights and a delegation of duties. But even after a delegation of duties, the **promisor remains liable** for breach if the delegatee fails to perform—unless the promisee agrees to release the promisor from his/her duties.

## 2.assignment[权利转让]

> [普通法中权利默认是可以转让的]An assignment is the transfer of **rights** under a contract to another (ie, assignee). The assignee takes all of the rights of the assignor as the contract stands at the time of the assignment.

### 2.1 permitted unless/exceptions

- materially increases obligor's contractual duties or risks.
- materially reduces obligor's chance of obtaining performance.
- is void (not merely prohibited) under contract provision[根据合同条款无效]

### 2.2 Consideration generally required to make assignment irrevocable[不可撤销]

> eg：the contract between the debtor and the creditor called for the debtor to make payments on the first day of each month. The parties effectively **modified** that contract when the creditor promised to accept payments on the fifth day of each month in exchange for the debtor's promise to make the payments by **cashier's check**.Since this occurred before the creditor assigned his rights under the loan contract to the bank, the debtor can justifiably insist that the payment date for the rest of the installments is the fifth of each month.

- there was **consideration** for the creditor's promise to accept payment at a later date (and the modification was effective) because the debtor altered his preexisting duty to pay the debt by promising to make future payments by cashier's check.

- Exceptions: promissory estoppel, delivery of document symbolizing assigned right (eg, stock certificate), delivery of written & signed assignment.

- There is no rule that makes a contract modification ineffective as to an assignee simply because the assignee had no **notice** of it.

- if one party in an agreement decides to waive or forgive a condition (a requirement that must be met for the contract to be fully enforced) for a specific performance or act, they still have the right to reinstate or re-enforce that condition for any future actions or performances under the agreement. However, that rule is **not applicable** here because the parties modified the contract by mutual agreement and the opportunity to reinstate a condition was no longer available.

### 2.3 Assignee's rights

> A party to a contract is generally free to assign (ie, transfer) its contractual rights to another. The recipient of those rights (assignee) then steps into the shoes of the assigning party (assignor) and assumes all of the assignor's contractual rights to the obligor's performance as they stand at the time of the assignment. However, those rights are subject to any claims or defenses that:

- accrued before obligor received notice of assignment.
- stem from assignor's present or future failure to perform.
- Assignor loses rights & therefore cannot enforce contract.

### 2.4 Silent as to assignment

> "Silent as to assignment" means that a contract or legal document does not include any provisions addressing whether rights or obligations under the agreement can be assigned to another party. When a contract is silent on assignment, the default legal rule in the relevant jurisdiction typically applies.
> In many cases, unless there is a specific prohibition, contract rights are generally assignable, but **obligations usually require the consent of the other party before being transferred**. However, the exact implications depend on the governing law of the contract.

- eg:the computer retail outlet and the bank entered a service contract that was silent as to assignment or delegation by either party. The retail outlet assigned the entire contract (ie, rights and duties) to a computer service company, but the bank did not release the retail outlet from its duties. So even though the computer service company was qualified and financially responsible, the bank can sue the retail outlet for damages arising from the computer service company's defective performance.

- When, as here, the **promisor delegates** his/her duties by forming a separate contract with the delegatee, the **promisee** of the original contract becomes an **intended beneficiary** of that separate contract. This allows the promisee to **sue the delegatee** (in addition to the promisor) in the event of a breach. The bank, as the intended beneficiary of the agreement between the retail outlet and the computer service company, can therefore sue the computer service company for damages—even though it made no promises to the bank.

## 3.novation [约务更替]

### 3.1 promisee's recovery for breach after promisor delegated dutites

|约定形式|vs promisor|vs delegatee|
| -- | -- | -- |
| informal delegation | yes | no |
| contractual delegation | yes | yes |
| contractual delegation + release(ie,novation) | no | yes |
