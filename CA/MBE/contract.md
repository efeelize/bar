# 一、合同的形成

# 1.如果同时出现普通法（UCC）和衡平法的适用选择

- 我们要关注合同是否成立，如果合同成立，一般来说按照前面的赔偿金解决问题，除非造成明显的不公。只有当合同没有成
立时才用衡平法理论解决问题，比如准合同、禁反言等;
- “让人做某事”，“不让人做某事”是衡平法的救济，普通法关注金钱上的赔偿;
- 普通法救济足够的时候，不用衡平法救济;
- 衡平法由法官审理事实，而不是陪审团;
- 普通法通常严格遵循法律和先例（先例也是法律的一部分），而衡平法更关注结果是否公平，但公平并非只有一种答案.

# 二、合同的有效性 & 可执行性

# 1.incapacity due to infancy

> Unmarried, unemancipated minors (ie, persons under the age of 18) lack capacity to contract because of their infancy. As a result, any contract entered by a minor is voidable by the minor.This means that the minor can either：

- ***void*** the contract before or soon after turning 18 by (1) disaffirming the contract through words or actions and (2) returning any still-existing benefit received under the contract or

- ***ratify*** the contract after turning 18 by (1) failing to timely void the contract or (2) otherwise agreeing to be bound by it—eg, by attempting to render performance of or payment under the contract.

> By statute in some jurisdictions, certain contracts entered by a minor (eg, student loanagreements, insurance contracts) are not voidable by the minor but instead are fullyenforceable by the other contracting party.

|阶段|情形|合同效力|
| -- | -- | -- |
| if minor,before or soon after turning 18 | disaffirms contract | voided[无效] |
| if minor,before or soon after turning 18 | returns any still-existing benefit received under contract | voided |
| if minor,after turning 18 | fails to timely void contract | ratified |
| if minor,after turning 18 | agrees to be bound by contract | ratified |
| if contract is for necessitites(food,clothing,medicine) | disaffirm contract but must pay value of benefits received | exception | 

# 2.mental inllness

> Mental capacity so deficient that party cannot reasonably understand (or act in relation to) nature or consequences of contract AND other party had reason to know

- Voidable[可撤销的] if disaffirmed by incapacitated party when lucid[清醒的] or by legal representative.

# 3.intoxication [醉酒（或吸毒、麻醉、被药物影响）]

> Party too intoxicated to reasonably understand (or act in relation to) nature or consequences of contract AND other party had reason to know

- Voidable[可撤销的] if promptly disaffirmed by intoxicated party upon becoming sober.

- Intoxicated party must offer to return any consideration received & may be liable for fair value of goods or services provided

# 4.Statute of Fraud/SOF [反欺诈法]

| / | meaning | common law | UCC |
| --- | --- | --- | ---- |
| writing |  Physical or electronic document(s) containing reasonable basis to believe contract was formed (eg, receipt, check, emails) | identifies parties, subject matter, consideration, time & nature of performance | lists quantity of goods (contract enforceable only up to written quantity) |
| signature | / | General rule – handwritten signature from, or other mark identifying, party to be charged[只要求被告签名] (eg, letterhead, electronic signature, initials[简签]) | Merchant exception – a written confirmation need only to be **signed by one merhant** and sent to the other merchant.If the recipient has reason to know the confirmation's contents and does not object within 10 days,then it is **enforceable against both merchants.** [提出反对的书面形式必须有签名,UCC的特殊规定] |

## 4.1 适用反欺诈法的情形/特殊合同必须要书面

> A contract need only be in writing and signed by the party to be charged if it falls within the statute of frauds. This rule applies to contracts for the sale of goods for $500 or more.

### （1）Marriage – a contract made in consideration of marriage

### （2）Year – a contract that cannot be completed within one year[从签订日期开始预计要超过一年才能完成的服务合同]

- The one-year provision of the statute of frauds applies to a contract whose terms make it impossible for any party to fully perform within one year. However, the parties' option to terminate the contract within a year does not remove it from the statute under the majority rule.

- Contracts whose terms make it impossible for any party to fully perform within one year,Excludes contracts of uncertain duration[时间不确定的合同] (eg, lifetime contracts).

### (3)Land – a contract for the sale or transfer of an interest in real property

- leases and easements for less than one year are usually excluded from the statute，even though it involves an interest in real property.

### (4)Executor – a contract to pay an estate's debt out of the executor's personal funds[遗产管理人自掏腰包支付死者的债务]

### （5）Goods – a contract for the sale of goods for $500 or more[500美金或以上的物品买卖合同]

- [UCC下只要数量确定]，the contract is enforceable since UCC gap-fillers will supply the price term at the time of delivery.***Under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) § 2-201, contracts for the sale of goods worth $500 or more must be in writing to be enforceable.***

### (6)Suretyship – a contract to answer for the debt or duty of another[担保合同]

## 4.2 merchant exception[UCC]

> Under the merchant exception, a written confirmation need only be **signed by one merchant** and sent to the other merchant. If the recipient has reason to know the confirmation's contents and does not object within 10 days, then it is **enforceable against both merchants**.

- the baker and the supplier are both merchants—regular dealers in flour. The baker's signed note was a sufficient writing because it confirmed that a contract was formed and listed the quantity of goods sold. Additionally, the supplier had reason to know the contents of the note (received and read it) and did not object within 10 days. Therefore, the contract was enforceable against both parties.

# 三、合同的修改

# 1.合同瑕疵汇总

|情形|结果|
| -- | -- |
| misunderstanding | 没有合同、没有合意，无效 (void) |
| 胁迫（duress） | 没有合同、没有合意，无效 (void) |
| 以违法（illegal）、违反公序良俗（contrary to public policy）为直接目的 | 没有合同、没有合意，无效 (void) |
| 被监护人接管的精神病人签订的合同 | 没有合同、没有合意，无效 (void) |
|没有对价、虚无的对价| 无法执行（unenforceable）|
| 违反反欺诈 | 无法执行（unenforceable）|
| 不合情理（unconscionable）| 无法执行（unenforceable）|
| 共同误解（mutual mistake）| 可撤销 （voidable）|
| 欺诈、虚假陈述、隐瞒重要事实 | 可撤销 （voidable）|
| 未成年签订的合同 | 可撤销 （voidable）|
| 被酒精（药物）影响，对方明知或应知 | 可撤销 （voidable）|
|间歇性精神病发作期间签订的合 | 可撤销 （voidable）|
| 非直接武力胁迫以外的不当威胁 | 可撤销 （voidable）|
| 不当影响（undue influence）| 可撤销 （voidable）|
| 合同本身不违法，但被用作违法意图 | 可撤销 （voidable）|

# 2.misunderstanding[条款理解不同]

| / | general rule | waiver |
| -- | -- | -- |
| neither/both parties know of misunderstanding | no contract formed[合同没有成立] | either party can enforce **other party’s** understanding |
| One party knows of misunderstanding | Contract formed based on unknowing party's understanding[如果一方知道对方的想法，合同按照对方所想成立] | Unknowing party can enforce knowing party's understanding |

> It occurs when the parties to a contract attach **different meanings** to the **same term**. If the misunderstanding involves a **material term**, most often there is no contract because there is no meeting of the minds.But if **one party knows or has reason to know about the misunderstanding**, then a valid contract will be formed based on the meaning of the **term as understood** by the **unknowing party**.

- Trade usage can be used to show that a word or phrase has a particular meaning—eg, that "daily service" does not include Sundays in the commercial laundry business. But trade usage will not control when a party knows that the other party attaches a different meaning to the term.

- When one party to a contract knows or has reason to know that the other party attaches a different meaning to a material term, then the unknowing party's meaning of the term will control.

# 3.mistake [事实认识错误]

## 3.1 unilateral mistake[单方面的事实认识错误]

## 3.2 mutual mistake [共同误解]

> When both parties enter a contract based on the same mistake (ie, mutual mistake), the contract is voidable by the adversely affected party if[受影响的一方可以撤销合同]:

- the mistake relates to a **basic assumption** of the contract
- the mistake **materially affects** the agreed-upon exchange of performances (ie, the adversely affected party cannot fairly be required to carry it out) and
- the adversely affected party does not assume the risk of the mistake.（ie，the agreement did not expressly allocate the risk of the mistake）.

## 3.3 allocate the risk

- A court can allocate the risk of a mistake—ie, an erroneous belief of fact held by one or both parties—to a party upon a finding that it is reasonable in the circumstances to do so (eg, based on that party's culpability). 

- But a court cannot allocate the risk of a misunderstanding—ie, the attachment of different meanings to the same term.

# 3.undue influence[不当影响]

> A contract is voidable for undue influence if a party's assent[同意] was the product of unfair or excessive persuasion by someone who dominate[支配] or shared a special relationship[特殊关系] of trust and confidence with that party.
> Persuasion is unfair or excessive if it seriously impairs the assenting party's ability to exercise free and competent judgment. The following factors are relevant to making this determination:

- Susceptibility of the assenting party (eg, elderly, in poor health).
- Unfairness of the resulting bargain (eg, sale of business for less than half its market value).
- Unavailability of independent advice (eg, attorney unavailable to discuss sale).

# 4.The parol evidence rule [口头证据规则]

## 4.1 合同以书面为准，签约之前的口头或书面沟通如果和正式的书面合同原文抵触则无法使用

> The UCC parol evidence rule bars evidence of any prior agreement (or contemporaneous[同时发生的] oral agreement) that contradicts the terms of an integrated writing.***U.C.C. § 2-202 (Am. Law Inst. & Unif. Law Comm'n 2020) (parol evidence rule).***

|type|definition|effect|
| -- | -- | --- |
| Complete integration[完备的合同] | Writing that sets forth parties' final agreement about all terms，常见：merger clause[完备条款]，all matters | （1）Excludes parol evidence within scope of agreement；（2）Parol evidence **inadmissible** to supplement (ie, add to) or contradict contract |
| Partial integration[不完备的合同] | Writing that sets forth parties' final agreement about some terms | （1）Excludes parol evidence inconsistent with agreement；（2）Parol evidence **admissible** to supplement (not contradict不抵触) contract |

## 4.2 口头证据规则的例外

### （1）collateral agreement [附属条款]
> This rule does not apply when such evidence is offered to prove the existence of a collateral agreement—ie, a separate contract supported by separate consideration.

### （2）conditions[合同条件]
> But this rule does not apply when a party is attacking the validity[有效性] of the agreement—eg, by asserting there was a condition precedent to effectiveness that failed to occur. As a result, evidence of such a condition precedent is admissible.

- 比如是为了证明合同只会在某个条件下才会生效（condition precedent），可以引入。

### （3）reformation[合同重写]
> 因双方共同的原因不慎导致双方约定的内容和正式的合同有差异，一方可以要求重写合同。

### （4）合同效力的例外
> However, this rule does not apply, and such evidence is always admissible, when the evidence is used to determine remedies for breach. For example, parol evidence is admissible to prove that ***consequential damages*** were foreseeable and are therefore recoverable.

- 签约之前的沟通如果是为了证明合同无效、可撤销、无法执行等效力问题，可以引入。这些沟通还可以用来证明合同是否完备（completely/fully integrated）。

## 4.3 合同签约之后的证据不被口头证据规则约束

### （1）例外：no-oral modification clause/NOM clause

| Rule | enforceable |
| -- | -- |
| common law (contracts for services or real estate) [普通法下，只要修改有对价，即便是口头也可以修改书面合同，NOM条款通常是无效] | NOM clause enforceable only if modification must be in writing under statute of frauds |
| UCC (contracts for sale of goods) [UCC下，NOM默认是有效的] | (1)All parties are merchants – NOM clause always enforceable;(2) > 1 party is nonmerchant – NOM clause in merchant's form must be separately signed by nonmerchant(s) to be enforceabl[非商家需要对NOM条款单独签名]|

- eg:the parties orally agreed to extend the exclusivity period by 60 days. Although the written agreement contained a NOM clause, the modified exclusivity period did not need to be evidenced by a writing since no statute of frauds provision applies. And since there was consideration—60 more days of exclusivity in exchange for 60 more days of service—the parties' oral agreement effectively modified their written agreement.

- The parol evidence rule generally prevents proof of prior or contemporaneous agreements that modify or contradict the terms of a written contract. But this rule does not prevent proof of subsequent agreements between the parties—eg, the oral agreement entered **after** the written listing agreement was executed.

## 4.4 trade usage

> Trade usage refers to a ***practice or method of dealing*** that is observed with such ***regularity in the industry*** that the parties to a contract would be expected to observe it.

# 5.unconscionable[不合情理的]

> The defense of unconscionability is available when a contract's bargaining process and/or the contract terms were so unfair to one party that no reasonable person would have agreed to it. When this occurs, the court can **modify or cancel** (ie, refuse to enforce) the contract. Factors used to determine whether a contract is unconscionable include:

- sophistication and knowledge of each party (eg, the parties' unequal knowledge of the timber industry[木材行业])
- disparity between the parties' bargaining power[除了接受不合理条款别无选择] (eg, the landowner is money-poor and the logger is the only potential buyer)
- disparity between the value of consideration exchanged by the parties (eg, the sale of timber rights on choice land for a price that is significantly lower than the prevailing rate) and
- one-sidedness of contract terms (eg, the contract terms overwhelmingly favor the logger).

# 6.misrepresentation[虚假陈述]

## 6.1 When disclosure is required to avoid misrepresentation

| / | required |
| ------ | ------ |
| Previous assertion | Disclosure would prevent previous assertion from being a misrepresentation or fraudulent or material |
| Mistake about basic assumption | (1)Disclosure would correct other party's mistake about basic assumption of contract + (2) Failure to disclose would constitute lack of good faith & fair dealing |
| Fiduciary[信托] relationship | Other party is entitled to know fact because of confidential/fiduciary relationship |
| Mistake about writing | Disclosure would correct other party's mistake about contents or effect of writing that embodies agreement |

### （1）合同可撤销的条件[仅受合同不利影响的一方]

- [欺诈的方式作出]The misrepresentation was fraudulent[欺诈性的](ie, made knowingly[故意] or recklessly with the intent to induce the other party's assent to the contract) OR material (ie, likely to induce a reasonable person's assent).

- [导致了对方同意合同]The misrepresentation induced assent to the contract.

- [受不利影响的一方有理由依赖虚假陈述]The adversely affected party justifiably relied on the misrepresentation.

# 7.illegal/contrary to public policy[违反公序良俗] contract 

## 7.1 效力
> An illegal contract generally is void and there is no remedy for a breach. However, in limited situations, a party to an illegal contract can recover either ***expectation damages*** (eg, if the party was justifiably ignorant of the illegality) OR ***restitution damages*** (eg, if the party was less culpable than the other party).

- 如果合同本身并不违法，只是被用于非法目的，且一方事先并不知情合同并不会无效。哪怕知情，只要1. 没有进一步促进违法行为，并且2. 非法目的不会造成严重的社会伤害，比如人身安全的威胁。依然可以要求另一方履行合同，或者赔偿不履行合同带来的损害。

### （1）expectation damages

> It can recover full vaule of lost performance.An illegal contract is enforceable for the full amount of the nonbreaching party's expectation damages if:

- the nonbreaching party was justifiably ignorant of the facts that made the contract illegal
- the nonbreaching party substantially performed and lacked an illegal purpose
- the contract can be easily separated into legal and illegal parts or
- the contract is illegal due to a violation of a licensing requirement designed only to raise revenue.

### （2）restitution damages[衡平法的救济,不当得利的返还]

> It can recover reasonable value of benefit conferred.A party to an illegal contract can recover such damages if that party conferred a benefit on the other party and:

- was justifiably ignorant of the facts that made the contract illegal*
- was less culpable than the other party or
- withdrew before the contract's illegal purpose was achieved and did not engage in serious misconduct.

## 7.2 例外：可执行

> When a contract violates a law that was designed to protect the party seeking to enforce the contract, the contract can be enforced to avoid frustrating the public policy behind the statute.

# 四、合同的解释
# 1.Rules of contract interpretation

> The plain-meaning rule of contract interpretation instructs courts to rely on the ordinary meaning of the words if the contract's language is clear and unambiguous.
> Evidence used to clarify the meaning of an ambiguous contract term is **excepted from the parol evidence rule**.

|rule|Court's interpret|
| ------ | ------ |
| Plain-meaning rule | Court interprets contract terms according to their plain meaning(unless parties clearly intended specialized meaning) |
| Plain-meaning rule | Goal is to effectuate parties' outward expressions of intent |
| Plain-meaning rule | Extrinsic evidence may be used to clarify ambiguous or overlyvague terms |
| Context rule | Court interprets contract terms by considering all facts &circumstances related to transaction |
| Context rule | (some courts)Goal is to effectuate parties' actual intent |

# 2.contra proferentem[不利解释原则]

> Contra proferentem is a legal principle used in contract interpretation. It means that if there is any ambiguity in a contract, the interpretation should be made against the party that drafted the contract. This rule helps protect the weaker or non-drafting party, ensuring that the drafter does not benefit from unclear language.

- Under the doctrine of contra proferentem, ambiguous contract terms are interpreted against the drafter to protect the rights of the nondrafter. But this doctrine does not apply when, as here, the terms are unambiguous.

# 五、 合同的履行

# 六、合同与第三人

| Type of provision | Explicit prohibitions | Assignment of rights | Delegation of duties |
| ------ | ------ | ---- | ----- |
| None | N/A | Allowed |     |
| Specific | Assignment of rights & delegation of duties | Barred |    |
| Specific | Assignment of rights only | Barred |  Allowed |
| Specific | Delegation of duties only | Allowed | Barred |  
| General | Assignment of "the contract" |   |    |

# 1.special clause

## 1.1 Nonassignment provisions

> Since the nonassignment provision (this contract may not be assigned") did not specify whether it applied to rights or duties, it will be construed to mean that duties may not be delegated.

- 普通法中，合同的权利默认都是可以转让的（assignment of rights），不需要经过另一方同意。甚至合同仅仅是禁止转让（no assignment of the contract），禁止的也只是义务的转让而不是权利的转让。只有合同明确禁止转让权利（no assignment of rights），转让方（assignor）才禁止转让权利。

- Nonassignment provisions are enforceable.

## 1.2 Silent as to assignment

> "Silent as to assignment" means that a contract or legal document does not include any provisions addressing whether rights or obligations under the agreement can be assigned to another party. When a contract is silent on assignment, the default legal rule in the relevant jurisdiction typically applies.
> In many cases, unless there is a specific prohibition, contract rights are generally assignable, but **obligations usually require the consent of the other party before being transferred**. However, the exact implications depend on the governing law of the contract.

- eg:the computer retail outlet and the bank entered a service contract that was silent as to assignment or delegation by either party. The retail outlet assigned the entire contract (ie, rights and duties) to a computer service company, but the bank did not release the retail outlet from its duties. So even though the computer service company was qualified and financially responsible, the bank can sue the retail outlet for damages arising from the computer service company's defective performance.

- When, as here, the **promisor delegates** his/her duties by forming a separate contract with the delegatee, the **promisee** of the original contract becomes an **intended beneficiary** of that separate contract. This allows the promisee to **sue the delegatee** (in addition to the promisor) in the event of a breach. The bank, as the intended beneficiary of the agreement between the retail outlet and the computer service company, can therefore sue the computer service company for damages—even though it made no promises to the bank.

# 2.delegate[义务转让]

> Contractual **duties** can be delegated by a party (ie, the promisor) to a nonparty (ie, the delegatee). An assignment of the entire contract will be construed as an assignment of rights and a delegation of duties. But even after a delegation of duties, the **promisor remains liable** for breach if the delegatee fails to perform—unless the promisee agrees to release the promisor from his/her duties.

## 2.1 禁止转让义务的情形

### （1）[合同明确禁止assignment或者禁止delegation]

> delegation is prohibited by contract

### （2）需要特殊技能的服务合同显然也不适合转让

> other contracting party has substantial interest in having delegating party perform (eg, in personal-services contract involving taste or special skill，比如设计)

# 3.assignment[权利转让]

> [普通法中权利默认是可以转让的]An assignment is the transfer of **rights** under a contract to another (ie, assignee). The assignee takes all of the rights of the assignor as the contract stands at the time of the assignment.

## 3.1 exceptions

- materially increases obligor's contractual duties or risks.
- materially reduces obligor's chance of obtaining performance.
- is void (not merely prohibited) under contract provision[根据合同条款无效]

## 3.2 Consideration generally required to make assignment irrevocable[不可撤销]

> If one party in an agreement decides to waive or forgive a condition (a requirement that must be met for the contract to be fully enforced) for a specific performance or act, they still have the right to reinstate or re-enforce that condition for any future actions or performances under the agreement. However, that rule is **not applicable** here because the parties modified the contract by mutual agreement and the opportunity to reinstate a condition was no longer available.

- eg：the contract between the debtor and the creditor called for the debtor to make payments on the first day of each month. The parties effectively **modified** that contract when the creditor promised to accept payments on the fifth day of each month in exchange for the debtor's promise to make the payments by **cashier's check**.Since this occurred before the creditor assigned his rights under the loan contract to the bank, the debtor can justifiably insist that the payment date for the rest of the installments is the fifth of each month.

- there was **consideration** for the creditor's promise to accept payment at a later date (and the modification was effective) because the debtor altered his preexisting duty to pay the debt by promising to make future payments by cashier's check.

- Exceptions: promissory estoppel, delivery of document symbolizing assigned right (eg, stock certificate), delivery of written & signed assignment.

- There is no rule that makes a contract modification ineffective as to an assignee simply because the assignee had no **notice** of it.

## 3.3 Assignee's rights

> A party to a contract is generally free to assign (ie, transfer) its contractual rights to another. The recipient of those rights (assignee) then steps into the shoes of the assigning party (assignor) and assumes all of the assignor's contractual rights to the obligor's performance as they stand at the time of the assignment. However, those rights are subject to any claims or defenses that:

- accrued before obligor received notice of assignment.
- stem from assignor's present or future failure to perform.
- Assignor loses rights & therefore cannot enforce contract.

# 4.novation [约务更替]

## 4.1 promisee's recovery for breach after promisor delegated dutites

|约定形式|vs promisor|vs delegatee|
| -- | -- | -- |
| informal delegation | yes | no |
| contractual delegation | yes | yes |
| contractual delegation + release(ie,novation) | no | yes |

# 5.A third-party beneficiary[受益第三人]

> A third-party beneficiary is a nonparty to a contract who receives an advantage or benefit from the contract.

## 5.1 intended beneficiary [故意受益第三人]

> Receive direct benefit from contract because contracting parties intended to benefit them.

- The third party can enforce the contract if the third party is an intended beneficiary (ie, one whom the contracting parties intended to benefit directly).

- An intended beneficiary does not need to rely on the doctrine of promissory estoppel[承诺性禁反言]—which allows a party to enforce a promise on which it relied when no valid contract was formed—to enforce its rights.

## 5.2 incidental beneficiary[附带受益第三人]

> Receive indirect benefit from contract even though there was no contractual intent to benefit them.
