# 二、合同的有效性 & 可执行性

# 1.incapacity due to infancy

> Unmarried, unemancipated minors (ie, persons under the age of 18) lack capacity to contract because of their infancy. As a result, any contract entered by a minor is voidable by the minor.This means that the minor can either：

- ***void*** the contract before or soon after turning 18 by (1) disaffirming the contract through words or actions and (2) returning any still-existing benefit received under the contract or

- ***ratify*** the contract after turning 18 by (1) failing to timely void the contract or (2) otherwise agreeing to be bound by it—eg, by attempting to render performance of or payment under the contract.

> By statute in some jurisdictions, certain contracts entered by a minor (eg, student loanagreements, insurance contracts) are not voidable by the minor but instead are fullyenforceable by the other contracting party.

|阶段|情形|合同效力|
| -- | -- | -- |
| if minor,before or soon after turning 18 | disaffirms contract | voided |
| if minor,before or soon after turning 18 | returns any still-existing benefit received under contract | voided |
| if minor,after turning 18 | fails to timely void contract | ratified |
| if minor,after turning 18 | agrees to be bound by contract | ratified |
| if contract is for necessitites(food,clothing,medicine) | disaffirm contract but must pay value of benefits received | exception |

## 1.misunderstanding【条款理解不同】

> [如果双方对实质性条款理解都不同，合同没有成立，如果一方知道对方的想法，合同按照对方所想成立]It occurs when the parties to a contract attach **different meanings** to the **same term**. If the misunderstanding involves a **material term**, most often there is no contract because there is no meeting of the minds.But if **one party knows or has reason to know about the misunderstanding**, then a valid contract will be formed based on the meaning of the **term as understood** by the **unknowing party**.

- Trade usage can be used to show that a word or phrase has a particular meaning—eg, that "daily service" does not include Sundays in the commercial laundry business. But trade usage will not control when a party knows that the other party attaches a different meaning to the term.

- When one party to a contract knows or has reason to know that the other party attaches a different meaning to a material term, then the unknowing party's meaning of the term will control.

# 四、合同的解释
## 1.Rules of contract interpretation

> The plain-meaning rule of contract interpretation instructs courts to rely on the ordinary meaning of the words if the contract's language is clear and unambiguous.

|rule|Court's interpret|
| ------ | ------ |
| Plain-meaning rule | Court interprets contract terms according to their plain meaning(unless parties clearly intended specialized meaning) |
| Plain-meaning rule | Goal is to effectuate parties' outward expressions of intent |
| Plain-meaning rule | Extrinsic evidence may be used to clarify ambiguous or overlyvague terms |
| Context rule | Court interprets contract terms by considering all facts &circumstances related to transaction |
| Context rule | (some courts)Goal is to effectuate parties' actual intent |

# 2.The parol evidence rule [口头证据规则]

> The parol evidence rule generally bars evidence of a prior oral or written agreement to modify or contradict the terms of a final written agreement. However, parol evidence is admissible to establish an ambiguous term—eg, when a term is subject to a misunderstanding.

# 3.contra proferentem[不利解释原则]

> Contra proferentem is a legal principle used in contract interpretation. It means that if there is any ambiguity in a contract, the interpretation should be made against the party that drafted the contract. This rule helps protect the weaker or non-drafting party, ensuring that the drafter does not benefit from unclear language.

> Under the doctrine of contra proferentem, ambiguous contract terms are interpreted against the drafter to protect the rights of the nondrafter. But this doctrine does not apply when, as here, the terms are unambiguous.

# 五、 合同的履行

# 六、合同与第三人

## 1.delegate[义务转让]

> Contractual **duties** can be delegated by a party (ie, the promisor) to a nonparty (ie, the delegatee). An assignment of the entire contract will be construed as an assignment of rights and a delegation of duties. But even after a delegation of duties, the **promisor remains liable** for breach if the delegatee fails to perform—unless the promisee agrees to release the promisor from his/her duties.

## 2.assignment[权利转让]

> [普通法中权利默认是可以转让的]An assignment is the transfer of **rights** under a contract to another (ie, assignee). The assignee takes all of the rights of the assignor as the contract stands at the time of the assignment.

### 2.1 Assignment of contractual rights

#### (1)permitted unless/exceptions

- materially increases obligor's contractual duties or risks
- materially reduces obligor's chance of obtaining performance
- is void (not merely prohibited) under contract provision[根据合同条款无效]

#### (2)Consideration generally required to make assignment irrevocable[不可撤销]

> eg：the contract between the debtor and the creditor called for the debtor to make payments on the first day of each month. The parties effectively **modified** that contract when the creditor promised to accept payments on the fifth day of each month in exchange for the debtor's promise to make the payments by **cashier's check**.Since this occurred before the creditor assigned his rights under the loan contract to the bank, the debtor can justifiably insist that the payment date for the rest of the installments is the fifth of each month.

- there was **consideration** for the creditor's promise to accept payment at a later date (and the modification was effective) because the debtor altered his preexisting duty to pay the debt by promising to make future payments by cashier's check.

- Exceptions: promissory estoppel, delivery of document symbolizing assigned right (eg, stock certificate), delivery of written & signed assignment.

### 2.2 Silent as to assignment

> "Silent as to assignment" means that a contract or legal document does not include any provisions addressing whether rights or obligations under the agreement can be assigned to another party. When a contract is silent on assignment, the default legal rule in the relevant jurisdiction typically applies.
> In many cases, unless there is a specific prohibition, contract rights are generally assignable, but **obligations usually require the consent of the other party before being transferred**. However, the exact implications depend on the governing law of the contract.

- eg:the computer retail outlet and the bank entered a service contract that was silent as to assignment or delegation by either party. The retail outlet assigned the entire contract (ie, rights and duties) to a computer service company, but the bank did not release the retail outlet from its duties. So even though the computer service company was qualified and financially responsible, the bank can sue the retail outlet for damages arising from the computer service company's defective performance.

- When, as here, the **promisor delegates** his/her duties by forming a separate contract with the delegatee, the **promisee** of the original contract becomes an **intended beneficiary** of that separate contract. This allows the promisee to **sue the delegatee** (in addition to the promisor) in the event of a breach. The bank, as the intended beneficiary of the agreement between the retail outlet and the computer service company, can therefore sue the computer service company for damages—even though it made no promises to the bank.

## 3.novation [约务更替]

### 3.1 promisee's recovery for breach after promisor delegated dutites

|约定形式|vs promisor|vs delegatee|
| -- | -- | -- |
| informal delegation | yes | no |
| contractual delegation | yes | yes |
| contractual delegation + release(ie,novation) | no | yes |
