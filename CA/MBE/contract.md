# 1.A declaratory judgment

> A declaratory judgment is a judgment from a court that defines the legal relationship that exists between the parties to a lawsuit, as well as their rights in the matter.

- The court's main concern is to give effect to the parties' outward expressions of intent, so the court will interpret the contract according to its plain (ie, ordinary) meaning whenever possible.Accordingly, if the contract's language is clear and unambiguous, the court will stop its interpretive process with that language.

# 2.contra proferentem[不利解释原则]

> Also known as "interpretation against the draftsman".The contra proferentem rule is a legal doctrine in contract law that dictates how ambigous clauses in a contract should be interpreted. The rule stipulates that if a clause in a contract is ambiguous or can be interpreted in multiple ways, it should be read in a way that disfavors the party who originally drafted, introduced, or demanded the inclusion of that specific clause.

- The plain-meaning rule of contract interpretation instructs courts to rely on the ordinary meaning of the words if the contract's language is clear and unambiguous.

# 3.misunderstanding

> It occurs when the parties to a contract attach different meanings to the same term. If the misunderstanding involves a material term, most often there is no contract because there is no meeting of the minds.But if one party knows or has reason to know about the misunderstanding, then a valid contract will be formed based on the meaning of the term as understood by the unknowing party.

- Trade usage can be used to show that a word or phrase has a particular meaning—eg, that "daily service" does not include Sundays in the commercial laundry business. But trade usage will not control when a party knows that the other party attaches a different meaning to the term.

- When one party to a contract knows or has reason to know that the other party attaches a different meaning to a material term, then the unknowing party's meaning of the term will control.

# 4.The parol evidence rule [口头证据规则]

> The parol evidence rule generally bars evidence of a prior oral or written agreement to modify or contradict the terms of a final written agreement. However, parol evidence is admissible to establish an ambiguous term—eg, when a term is subject to a misunderstanding.
