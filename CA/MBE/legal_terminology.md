# A declaratory judgment

> A declaratory judgment is a judgment from a court that defines the legal relationship that exists between the parties to a lawsuit, as well as their rights in the matter.

- The court's main concern is to give effect to the parties' outward expressions of intent, so the court will interpret the contract according to its plain (ie, ordinary) meaning whenever possible.Accordingly, if the contract's language is clear and unambiguous, the court will stop its interpretive process with that language.

# disaffirm

> "Disaffirm" means to reject, repudiate, or declare something as void. It is commonly used in legal contexts to refer to the act of denying or refusing to uphold a contract, agreement, or obligation. For example, a minor can disaffirm a contract they entered into before reaching the age of majority, making it unenforceable.

# voidable

> "Voidable" refers to a legal agreement or contract that is valid and enforceable but can be declared invalid by one of the parties due to specific legal reasons. Unlike a void contract, which is invalid from the outset and has no legal effect, a voidable contract remains in force until the party with the right to void it chooses to do so.

Courts usually order specific performance when damages are insufficient and the contract terms are clear and enforceable.

# accrued

- Secured claims[有担保索赔]: These are debts that are backed by collateral. If the debtor fails to pay, the creditor has the right to take the collateral to satisfy the debt. Common examples of secured claims are mortgages (where the property serves as collateral) or car loans (where the car is collateral).
- Unsecured claims[无担保索赔]: These are debts that are not backed by collateral. If the debtor defaults, the creditor has no specific asset to claim. Instead, the creditor must go through the legal process to try to collect the debt. Examples include credit card debt, medical bills, and personal loans.

- Reasonable reliance – The party must have relied on the promise in a way that a reasonable person would.
- Substantial detriment – The reliance must have led to significant harm or loss.

# unfair surprise

> "Unfair surprise" is a legal concept that refers to a situation where one party is taken by surprise by a legal outcome, action, or event that they were not adequately prepared for, often because of a lack of notice or sufficient opportunity to respond. This can occur in legal proceedings when one party feels that they were caught off guard by a development that they didn't anticipate, typically due to a procedural flaw or an unexpected change in the course of the case. The concept is often invoked in situations involving fairness and due process, such as in contract disputes, trials, or settlement negotiations.

# fiduciary[信托]

- Reformation is a legal remedy used when there has been a mistake in the contract (like clerical errors or misrepresentations) that does not accurately capture what both parties originally agreed upon. It involves changing the contract's wording or provisions to reflect what the parties actually intended at the time the contract was made.

- Reformation can be done by mutual agreement or ordered by a court if it finds that the contract does not accurately express the true agreement between the parties.

# UCC gap-fillers

> UCC gap-fillers are provisions in the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) that help resolve situations where parties to a contract haven't specified certain terms. In other words, when a contract under the UCC is silent on a particular matter, these gap-fillers "fill in the gaps" by providing default rules that apply unless the parties agree otherwise.

- Price: If the contract doesn’t specify a price for goods, the UCC will imply a reasonable price at the time of delivery.
- Time:If the contract doesn’t specify when performance is due, the UCC will imply a reasonable time for performance.
