# 一、personal jurisdiction【确定哪个州对案件有管辖权】

> 主要通过对人身管辖权（In Personam Jurisdiction）、对物管辖权（In Rem Jurisdiction）以及准对物管辖权（Quasi in Rem Jurisdiction）、长臂管辖（Long Arm Jurisdiction）实现对被告的属人管辖权（Personal Jurisdiction），进而确定哪个州对诉讼案件具有管辖权。

## 1.general jurisdiction

- General jurisdiction exists when the defendant's contacts with the forum state make the defendant "at home" there.

> personal jurisdiction can also be established through general jurisdiction. This exists when the defendant has continuous and systematic contacts with the forum state that are so substantial that the defendant is essentially "at home" in that state. Home is where the defendant is domiciled.

### 1.1 对人身管辖权（In Personam Jurisdiction）

- person:住所地 [state of residence].
- corporation:state of incorporation [注册地] or headquarters [主要营业地].

> - eg, the shoe company was incorporated in State A and has its principal place of business in State B. And though the company conducts business and stores inventory in State C, this is not where the company is domiciled.

## 2.sepcific jurisdiction/长臂管辖[long arm statutes]

> 长臂管辖指，被告虽然未出现在法院辖区范围内，但仍将被视为受州法院的属人管辖。长臂管辖同时适用于外国和外州两类非居民。

- Specific jurisdiction exists when the claim arises from or is closely related to the defendant's contacts with the forum state[**ie,A forum state is the jurisdiction (typically a state or country) where a legal case is filed and heard.**] such that the exercise of personal jurisdiction complies with fair play and substantial justice.

- No state has specific jurisdiction over a claim when it is based on events that occurred in the foreign country.

> A court must have personal jurisdiction—ie, authority over the parties (or property) before it—to hear a dispute. Personal jurisdiction can be established through specific jurisdiction, which exists when:
>
> - the plaintiff's **claim arises** from or is **closely related** to the defendant's minimum contacts with the forum state and
> - the exercise of jurisdiction complies with notions of **fair play and substantial justice**.

## 3.other grounds

- service of process
- consent

## 4.对物管辖权（In Rem Jurisdiction）、准对物管辖权（Quasi in Rem Jurisdiction）

> 除上述人身管辖权方面，在以被告的财产作为管辖的依据方面，存在对物管辖权或准对物管辖权（In Rem and Quasi in Rem Jurisdiction），这种管辖权不是针对当事人享有的管辖权，而是由于物或财产位于某一州而由该州享有管辖权。原告在无法获得对被告的对人身管辖权时就会采用这种类型的准对物管辖权。

# 二、subject matter jurisdiction[确定案件由联邦法院还是州法院管辖]

## 1.联邦法院专属管辖【联邦法院不管人身相关】

> - the federal court has subject-matter jurisdiction over the plaintiff's claims—eg, when a claim arises under the U.S. Constitution, a treaty, or federal law.
> - State and federal courts have concurrent (ie, shared) jurisdiction over most state-law claims. The only substantive areas over which state courts have exclusive jurisdiction are probate matters (eg, authenticating a will) and domestic relations (eg, issuing a divorce).

## 2.diversity jurisdiction【不同州公民之间的案件或州公民与外国人之间的案件】

> when the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000 and the opposing parties are citizens of different states.[争议超过$75000+对方是不同州的citizen.citizen以提起诉讼至法院的时间点为准,包括搬家去了别的州]

- Citizenship is determined on the date that the plaintiff's complaint is filed with the court.including though both parties were State A citizens when they entered the contract and are currently State A citizens, the plaintiff was a State B citizen when he filed the complaint. As a result, the parties were diverse when the filing occurred—satisfying the requirements for diversity jurisdiction

- Citizenship is usually determined by the domiciles of the named parties to the suit. For purposes of diversity jurisdiction, the citizenship of a legal representative is determined by the domicile of the minor, legally incompetent person, or decedent on whose behalf the legal representative acts.[未成年人、无民事行为能力人的法代的citizenship由被代理人决定]

- To satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement, a single plaintiff can aggregate (ie, combine) claims asserted against a single defendant.[单个原告起诉单个被告，金额可累计]

## 3.removal 【管辖权的移转：被告请求移送联邦法院】

> A Notice of Removal is a legal document that a defendant files with the court to move a case from state court to federal court. This is typically done when the defendant believes the case should be heard in federal court rather than state court, often due to issues like diversity of citizenship or federal question jurisdiction.

### 3.1 联邦法院有管辖权

### 3.2 被告同意

- 只能由被告提出[因反诉而进入案件的被告无权提起]+When a case has more than one defendant, the consent of all defendants must be obtained before the case can be removed from state to federal court.【每个被告都必须同意】；

> - A plaintiff cannot remove a case, even if there is a risk of bias and impropriety in having the case proceed before a hostile state-court judge.
> - Only defendants listed in the plaintiff's complaint have the power to remove a case from state to federal court. A party joined to the suit through a counterclaim is not considered a defendant for removal purposes.
> - After removal, if a plaintiff seeks to join additional defendants who would destroy diversity jurisdiction, the federal court may deny joinder and proceed with the case OR permit joinder and remand the case to state court.
> - However, the federal court should remand the case back to state court if there was a procedural error in the removal. Since only defendants listed in the complaint may remove a case, a procedural error occurs when a case is removed by a party other than a defendant. This includes a party joined to the suit by a defendant's counterclaim.

### 3.3 30日内提交

> - 必须在发现可以转联邦管辖之时起30日内提出，且在diversity案件中最长不能超过受理后1年，但原告恶意利用该规则除外[如无新事实，却卡时间点增加诉请金额超过$75000]；
> - The defendant must file a notice of removal in federal court within 30 days after receiving the initial complaint or service of the summons—whichever period is shorter.

### 3.4 送达各方

> - 材料递交：州法院所在地区的联邦法院+copy送达给各方当事人+州法院->州法院收到通知后暂停审理
> - a copy of the notice of removal is delivered to the state court and the other parties

### 3.5 举证责任

> The burden is then on the party seeking removal to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that removal is proper.

- a preponderance of the evidence is a legal standard used in civil cases to determine the burden of proof. It means that one party's version of events is more likely true than not. In other words, the evidence presented by one party must outweigh that presented by the opposing party, showing that the claim is more probable than not (i.e., greater than 50% likelihood).

## 4.Remand[管辖权的移转：原告请求发回州法院]

- 需要遵循home-court-advantage rule.(ie,forum-defendant rule)：如果都有管辖权+案子起诉在被告所在的州法院，由州法院管辖，不可移送至联邦法院。

> A Motion to Remand is filed by a party (typically the plaintiff) to request the court to send a case back to state court after it has been removed to federal court. This is done when the plaintiff believes the removal was improper, usually due to a lack of federal jurisdiction or procedural defects in the removal process.

### 4.1 no subject matter jurisdiction

- Had the federal court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over some of the plaintiff's claims (eg, plaintiff's state claims), it would have remanded those claims but kept the removable claims (eg, plaintiff‘s federal claims).
- note:When a dispute involves multiple claims and only some fall within the court's original subject-matter jurisdiction, supplemental jurisdiction may exist over the remaining claims.

|example|result|
|-------|------|
|No subject-matter jurisdiction over any claim|Remand entire case|
|No subject-matter jurisdiction over some claims|(1)Retain removable claims;(2)Sever & remand nonremovable claims|

### 4.2 Procedural error

- If there was a procedural error in the removal, the federal court should remand the entire case to state court.

- The federal court clerk must mail a certified copy of the remand order to the state court clerk. The order may require payment of costs, including attorney's fees. But if a remand is based on procedural error, attorney's fees can only be awarded if there was no objectively reasonable basis for removal.

|example|result|
|-------|------|
|Defendant filed notice of removal more than 30 days after|Remand entire case|
|Not all defendants consented to removal|Remand entire case|
|Case removed by plaintiff (not defendant)|Remand entire case|
|Notice not delivered to parties or state court|Remand entire case|
|Removal violates forum-defendant rule|Remand entire case|

### 4.3 提出时间

- 如果基于removal程序瑕疵，需要在removal后30天内提出；
- 如果基于联邦法院没有subject matter jurisdiction,可以在任何时候提出。包括答辩中未抗辩，之后再次提出，不因未抗辩视为放弃remand的权利。

> - A party can challenge removal by filing a motion to remand (ie, return) the case to state court. This motion must generally be filed in federal court within 30 days after the notice of removal is filed, but a motion based on lack of subject-matter jurisdiction can be filed at any time.
> - Most defenses are waived if they are not asserted in a defendant's answer. But a defense based on lack of subject-matter jurisdiction is never waived and can be asserted by a party or raised by the court at any time—including after an answer has been filed.

## 5. special rules

### 5.1 home-court-advantage rule

> It refers to the perceived advantage of a party litigating in its home jurisdiction or a jurisdiction more favorable to its case.

- Familiarity with local laws, judges, and court procedures.
- Easier access to evidence and witnesses.
- Reduced travel costs and logistical challenges.
- Jurisdiction-specific bias in favor of local plaintiffs or defendants.

### 5.2 The forum-defendant rule

> - The forum-defendant rule is a legal principle under U.S. federal law that restricts the removal of certain cases from state court to federal court when certain conditions are met. The rule is codified in 28 U.S.C. § 1441(b)(2), which states:A civil action otherwise removable solely on the basis of [diversity jurisdiction] may not be removed if any of the parties in interest properly joined and served as defendants is a citizen of the state in which such action is brought.
> - This rule prohibits removal when subject-matter jurisdiction[对事管辖权] arises from diversity jurisdiction and a defendant is a citizen of the state where the case was filed.

### 5.3 forum-selection clause

> - A forum-selection clause is a contractual provision that designates the location and/or court where any dispute between the parties must be adjudicated. Although such clauses are generally enforceable, federal courts strictly follow the rules regarding removal—including the home-court-advantage rule—over these clauses.
> - To enforce a forum-selection clause requiring that a dispute be resolved in federal court, a defendant would need to move to dismiss the state court action. If the state court dismisses the action, the plaintiff would then need to refile the case in federal court

# 三、增加诉讼请求，提出反诉、交叉诉求时的Supplementary Jurisdiction【补充管辖】

> When a dispute involves multiple claims and one falls outside of the court's original jurisdiction, the court may exercise supplemental jurisdiction over that claim. However, the court can only do so if the claims are so related that they **share a common nucleus of operative facts/same transaction or occurence**.【原本不归联邦法院管辖的诉讼请求，因其与在审案件的关联性，在符合条件时由联邦法院来管辖，即诉讼请求必须与已在联邦法院审理的案件是基于相同的交易或事件发生。】

## 1.restriction

> - **when the original claim is based solely on diversity jurisdiction, supplemental jurisdiction is not permitted if the supplemental claim**
> - The key reason for this restriction is that supplemental jurisdiction is meant to allow federal courts to hear claims that are related to a case already under federal jurisdiction.
> - A court is generally permitted to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim that does not satisfy subject-matter jurisdiction when that claim shares a common nucleus of operative facts as a claim originally within the court's subject-matter jurisdiction.

# 四、venue

## 1.Venue is proper in any district where:

- any defendant resides, if all defendants reside in the same state (ie, residency-based venue)
- a substantial part of the events that gave rise to the suit occurred (ie, events-based venue) or a substantial part of the property is located (ie, property-based venue) or
- any defendant is subject to the court's personal jurisdiction—but only if neither of the above provisions applies (ie, fallback provision).

# 五、Joinder

- diversity jurisdiction 中的$75,000的要求共同诉讼中可以合并计算,但是counter claim[基于不同事由],crossclaim 需单独计算，不可合本诉合并计算金额。

> - a single plaintiff may only aggregate (ie, combine) claims against multiple defendants if the plaintiff alleges that they are jointly liable.
> - the consumer's claim concerning a kitchen appliance is unrelated to the retailer's crossclaim concerning power tools, so the court lacks supplemental jurisdiction over the crossclaim.

## 2. crossclaim

> A crossclaim is a claim brought by one party against a co-party in the same lawsuit. Co-parties are typically defendants or plaintiffs on the same side of a case. A crossclaim arises when one party believes that a co-party is partially or fully responsible for the harm or liability at issue, or has a related legal claim arising out of the same transaction or occurrence.

# 六、service：procedural rules+due process

## 1.methods of serving process in U.S

> failure to prove service in the U.S. or abroad does not affect the validity of the service.

|individual method|notes|
|-------|------|
|Personal service.|when process is delivered in person to the defendant.|
|Substituted service:Following state law where district court is located or where service is made.|when process is delivered to the defendant's agent or left at the defendant's dwelling with a resident of suitable age and discretion|
|State procedural rules.|when process is served pursuant to the rules of the state where the court sits or service is attempted|

|organization method|notes|
|-------|------|
|Delivering summons & complaint to defendant's authorized agent.|/|
|Substituted service:Following state law|where district court is located or where service is made.|
|Delivering summons & complaint to officer, managing or general agent, or authorized agent & mailing those documents to defendant if required by statute.|/|

## 2.Methods of serving process in foreign country

- organizations cannot be served by personal delivery in foreign countries.

|individual or organization method|result|
|-------|------|
|Following international agreement reasonably calculated to give notice|/|
|If no international agreement & not prohibited by federal law|(1)following foreign country's rules|
|If no international agreement & not prohibited by federal law|(2)as foreign country directs in response to letter rogatory or|
|If no international agreement & not prohibited by federal law|(3)unless prohibited by foreign country, by personal delivery or mail with request for signed return receipt|

|Foreign government method|result|
|-------|------|
|Following court order, unless prohibited by international agreement|/|
|Following special arrangement between plaintiff & foreign state|/|
|If no special arrangement|by international convention|
|If no convention|by mail to head of foreign affairs ministry with request for signed return receipt|
|If service by mail cannot be made within 30 days|by sending two copies to U.S. Secretary of State via mail requiring signed receipt|

## 3.due process

> the plaintiff must notify the defendant of the lawsuit by the most reasonable means under the circumstances.

### 3.1 18岁以上[federal process]+非当事人[律师可以]

> - A defendant receives proper notice when someone who is at least 18 years old and not a party to the suit serves the defendant with a summons and complaint.
> - However, any nonparty who is at least 18 years old can serve process. If service was not waived and occurred within the U.S., the process server must typically file a proof of service affidavit.

### 3.2 按照法院所在州或送达所在州的送达程序法律送达联邦诉讼

- 对未成年人、限制或无民事行为能力人[incomptent person]的送达只能适用州法。

> - And under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (FRCP) 4, any defendant (an individual or organization) can be served for a federal suit by following the state law for serving process in the state where the court is located or where service is made.
> - ie,the student sued the university (organization) and its athletic director (individual) in federal court in State B. Since the defendants can be served under the civil procedure rules of State B (where the court is located), this is the best method of serving both defendants.

### 3.3 Service by publication

- It means in the rare instance when the defendant's identity or address is unknown and unobtainable.
- But if the plaintiff knows or can reasonably obtain this information, a more reasonable means of service must be used.
