# 一、管辖权移送

- 被告提交removal请求把案子移送到联邦法院：（1）联邦专属管辖；（2）都有管辖权+争议超过$75000+对方是不同州的公民
- 原告提交remand请求把案子移送到州法院：需要遵循home-court-advantage rule。forum-defendant rule：如果都有管辖权+案子起诉在被告所在的州法院，由州法院管辖，不可移送至联邦法院。

## 1.a notice of removal[转联邦法院管辖]

- 只能由被告提出[因反诉而进入案件的被告无权提起]+每个被告都必须同意[When a case has more than one defendant, the consent of all defendants must be obtained before the case can be removed from state to federal court.]；
- 必须在发现可以转联邦管辖之时起30日内提出，且在diversity案件中最长不能超过受理后1年，但原告恶意利用该规则除外[如无新事实，却卡时间点增加诉请金额超过$75000]；
- 材料递交：州法院所在地区的联邦法院+copy送达给各方当事人+州法院->州法院收到通知后暂停审理

> - A Notice of Removal is a legal document that a defendant files with the court to move a case from state court to federal court. This is typically done when the defendant believes the case should be heard in federal court rather than state court, often due to issues like diversity of citizenship or federal question jurisdiction.
> - Only defendants listed in the plaintiff's complaint have the power to remove a case from state to federal court. A party joined to the suit through a counterclaim is not considered a defendant for removal purposes.
> - federal-question jurisdiction – when a claim arises under the U.S. Constitution, a treaty, or federal law (not seen here) or
> - diversity jurisdiction – when the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000 and the opposing parties are citizens of different states.
> - The defendant must file a notice of removal in federal court within 30 days after receiving the initial complaint or service of the summons—whichever period is shorter.
> - After removal, if a plaintiff seeks to join additional defendants who would destroy diversity jurisdiction, the federal court may deny joinder and proceed with the case OR permit joinder and remand the case to state court

## 2.A Motion to Remand[申请发回]

> - A Motion to Remand is filed by a party (typically the plaintiff) to request the court to send a case back to state court after it has been removed to federal court. This is done when the plaintiff believes the removal was improper, usually due to a lack of federal jurisdiction or procedural defects in the removal process.
> - A motion for remand places the burden on the defendant to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that removal was proper.
> - However, the federal court should remand the case back to state court if there was a procedural error in the removal. Since only defendants listed in the complaint may remove a case, a procedural error occurs when a case is removed by a party other than a defendant. This includes a party joined to the suit by a defendant's counterclaim.

### 2.1 remand based on impropre removal

#### (1)no subject matter jurisdiction

|example|result|
|-------|------|
||No subject-matter jurisdiction over any claim|Remand entire case|
|No subject-matter jurisdiction over some claims|(1)Retain removable claims;(2)Sever & remand nonremovable claims|

#### （2）Procedural error

- 如果基于removal程序瑕疵，需要在removal后30天内提出；
- 如果基于联邦法院没有subject matter jurisdiction/SMJ,可以在任何时候提出。

|example|result|
|-------|------|
|Defendant filed notice of removal more than 30 days after|Remand entire case|
|Not all defendants consented to removal|Remand entire case|
|Case removed by plaintiff (not defendant)|Remand entire case|
|Notice not delivered to parties or state court|Remand entire case|
|Removal violates forum-defendant rule|Remand entire case|

## 3.home-court-advantage rule

### 3.1 meaning

> The term refers to the perceived advantage of a party litigating in its home jurisdiction or a jurisdiction more favorable to its case.

### 3.2 Examples include

- Familiarity with local laws, judges, and court procedures.
- Easier access to evidence and witnesses.
- Reduced travel costs and logistical challenges.
- Jurisdiction-specific bias in favor of local plaintiffs or defendants.

### 3.3 The forum-defendant rule

> - The forum-defendant rule is a legal principle under U.S. federal law that restricts the removal of certain cases from state court to federal court when certain conditions are met. The rule is codified in 28 U.S.C. § 1441(b)(2), which states:A civil action otherwise removable solely on the basis of [diversity jurisdiction] may not be removed if any of the parties in interest properly joined and served as defendants is a citizen of the state in which such action is brought.
> - This rule prohibits removal when subject-matter jurisdiction[对事管辖权] arises from diversity jurisdiction and a defendant is a citizen of the state where the case was filed.

### 3.4 forum-selection clause

> - A forum-selection clause is a contractual provision that designates the location and/or court where any dispute between the parties must be adjudicated. Although such clauses are generally enforceable, federal courts strictly follow the rules regarding removal—including the home-court-advantage rule—over these clauses.
> - To enforce a forum-selection clause requiring that a dispute be resolved in federal court, a defendant would need to move to dismiss the state court action. If the state court dismisses the action, the plaintiff would then need to refile the case in federal court
